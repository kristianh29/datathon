May 1st,Western Front,43.000039640351694,-70.9632045382392,"""Announcements from the German General Government. Daily German report. BERLIN, May 1st. (Official report from this afternoon.) Western Front. The battles on the western bank of the canal to the northwest of Ypres, which we mentioned yesterday, ended in a very costly defeat for the enemy. To the east of the canal, north of Ypres, he made futile attacks. The bombardment of the fortress of Dunkirk continues. Between the Meuse and the Moselle, infantry battles only took place in the area of Ailly and Apremont. All French attacks failed and cost the enemy very heavy losses. In response to the shelling of our rest areas behind the front, we launched several shells into Reims on April 29th. The enemy can easily avoid a bombardment of Reims, as he is well aware of the reason for our actions. Yesterday, the enemy again lost three aircraft. To the northwest of Thielt, an English aircraft was shot down; another aircraft was brought down and destroyed by our fire near Wieltje, northwest of Ypres. The third, which was part of an enemy squadron, had to land at Nieder-Sulzbach.

Eastern Front. The battle at Szawla ended in our favor. The enemy, who suffered heavy losses, fled in the direction of Nitau after setting Szawla on fire in four places. The pursuit continues. So far, we have captured 1,000 prisoners and seized ten machine guns, large quantities of goods, ammunition wagons, and especially a lot of ammunition. Enemy attacks at Kalvaria and to the southwest of there were repelled with significant losses for the Russians. Here we captured another 350 men. However, the Russians succeeded in overrunning a German outpost company southwest of Augustowo at night and inflicted severe losses. East of Plock and on the southern bank of the Pilica, we repelled weak Russian attacks.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 1st. On April 30th, at 5:25 p.m., the Headquarters reports: At Kaba Tepe and Gallipoli, the enemy attempted to escape from the narrow strip of land on which he was trapped. However, we thwarted his attempts and forced him back to within 500 meters of the coastline, where he found protection from his fleet. We inflicted extraordinarily heavy losses on him. We completely thwarted an enemy attempt to land troops in the Gulf of Saros under the protection of part of his fleet. From the other battlefields, there is nothing significant to report.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 1st. It is reported from Erzerum: For three days, battles between scouts have been taking place south of Artvin. The enemy was repulsed everywhere with heavy losses. After a two-hour battle, the Russians retreated eastward.

Daily German Report.

BERLIN, May 3. (Official report from
this afternoon.)

Western Theater of War.

- In Flanders, we successfully launched attacks on both sides of the Poelkappelle-Ypres road and captured the farms ""The Fortune"", southeast of St. Julian. In Champagne, our well-executed mine explosions caused significant damage to the enemy position between Souain and Perthes. Between the Meuse and Moselle, only artillery was active yesterday. At Hartmannswillerkopf, the French unsuccessfully attempted to attack our position on the summit last night. Yesterday, a French aircraft landed at Hundlingen, west of Sargemund; both occupants were captured. A German aircraft squadron successfully attacked, evidently, the aircraft hangar and the station of Epinal.

Eastern Theater of War.

In the pursuit of the Russians fleeing towards Riga, we captured 4 cannons, 4 machine guns, and took 1,700 prisoners south of Mitau yesterday. This brings the total number of prisoners to 3,200. Southwest of Kalvaria, Russian attacks failed with heavy losses for the enemy: the Russians were driven back over the Scesupa and left 330 prisoners in our hands. The Russians also suffered a severe defeat northeast of Skierniewice: in addition to numerous dead, they lost 100 men as prisoners.

Southeastern Theater of War.

In the presence of the supreme commander, Field Marshal Archduke Friedrich, and under the leadership of General von Mackensen, the allied troops broke through the entire Russian front in Western Galicia yesterday after bitter battles, from near the Hungarian border to the mouth of the Dunajec in the Vistula, and pushed it back everywhere. The enemy troops that could escape are being closely pursued by the allied armies in full retreat to the east. The spoils of victory cannot yet be estimated, even approximately.

Western theatre of war.

In Flanders, we continue our attacks in the North and in
the East with very good success. This morning Seven-
kot, Zonnebeke, Westhoek, the Polygon Wood,
and Nonne Bosschen — possession of which
was fought over fiercely for months —
fell into our hands. The retreating enemy stands
north and south of Ypres in the firing
line of our batteries. In the Argonne,
the French unsuccessfully attempted to recapture a trench
north of Le Four de Paris, which we took on May 1. Yesterday,
the artillery battles between the Meuse
and the Moselle continued.

The number of captured Russians in the pursuit towards Mitau has risen
above 4,000. New Russian attacks southwest of Kalvaria were
repulsed; 170 prisoners remained in our
hands. Russian attacks also failed southeast of Augustowo,
where the enemy suffered heavy losses and in addition lost 4 officers
with 420 men as prisoners and
8 machine guns. Near Jedwabno,
northeast of Lomza, we likewise repelled
a Russian night attack.

VIENNA, May 4. (Official report from
today.) The allied German and Austro-
Hungarian troops have achieved a new victory
in loyal comradeship. Since the Russian retreat, after
our victory at Limanowa in West
Galicia, we have conquered the very fortified
enemy front between the Vistula and the
main ridge of the Carpathians, over its entire
extent. In the continued attack,
Austro-Hungarian and German forces achieved new advantages
on the whole front yesterday, in the presence of the supreme
commander, Field Marshal Archduke
Friedrich. Unstoppably, they advanced further eastward and repeatedly forced significant Russian
forces to a swift retreat. The outcome
of this battle also cannot yet be determined. So far, we have
counted more than 30,000 prisoners, and their number
increases by the hour. In the numerous captured
Russian positions, we seized a
large amount of war material. 22 pieces
of artillery and 64 machine guns belong
to the first spoils. On all other fronts,
the general situation is unchanged.

Western theatre of war.

In Flanders, we continue our attacks in the North and in
the East with very good success. This morning Seven-
kot, Zonnebeke, Westhoek, the Polygon Wood,
and Nonne Bosschen — possession of which
was fought over fiercely for months —
fell into our hands. The retreating enemy stands
north and south of Ypres in the firing
line of our batteries. In the Argonne,
the French unsuccessfully attempted to recapture a trench
north of Le Four de Paris, which we took on May 1. Yesterday,
the artillery battles between the Meuse
and the Moselle continued.

Eastern theatre of war.

The number of captured Russians in the pursuit towards Mitau has risen
above 4,000. New Russian attacks southwest of Kalvaria were
repulsed; 170 prisoners remained in our
hands. Russian attacks also failed southeast of Augustowo,
where the enemy suffered heavy losses and in addition lost 4 officers
with 420 men as prisoners and
8 machine guns. Near Jedwabno,
northeast of Lomza, we likewise repelled
a Russian night attack.

The English are retreating with very heavy losses further in the direction of the bridgehead just east of Ypres. The farm of Heule, Eksternest, the castle park of Herenthage, and the farm Het Pappatje fell into our hands. Between Meuse and Moselle, there was again greater activity noted. The French attacked yesterday with strong forces in the Priest's Forest, northwest of Pont-à-Mousson. Despite a long preparation by artillery, the attack was repulsed by our fire with significant losses for the enemy. In contrast, we went on the offensive in the Ailly Forest and east of there, making good progress. So far we have captured 10 officers and 750 men there.

Eastern theater.

Attacks from the southeast on Raszinie were repelled. We are pursuing the enemy. Numerous forward movements of the Russians at Kalvaria, northeast of Suwalki, and east of Augustowo failed as well. In the process, the enemy lost about 500 men as prisoners. In other parts of the front, isolated hand-to-hand combat occurred, all ending in our favor.

Southeastern theater.

Yesterday, north of the Wood Carpathians, the allied armies broke through the third fortified Russian line. Completely defeated on the entire front, the latter are retreating to the Wisloka. The fact that the Russians are beginning to evacuate their positions southwest of Dukla in the Wood Carpathians, which are endangered from the north as a result of the breakthrough by the allies, sufficiently indicates the significance of our victory. Given the speed with which our troops executed this feat of arms, the full extent of the outcome can't yet be precisely described. According to reports received so far, we appear to have captured more than 30,000 prisoners.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 4. The Grand Headquarters reported yesterday: The enemy tried to advance with the left wing to expand the small strip of land they hold near Ariburnu. We threw them back through our counterattacks with considerable losses into the very rocky valleys and then drove them towards the coast. At the same time, our batteries set an enemy transport ship on fire. The other transport ships, which were near the coast, fled in haste. The battleship ""Agamemnon,"" which attempted to shell Bulair indirectly, was hit by four shells yesterday. It withdrew as it could no longer respond to our fire. Seven armed sailors and an officer, who had landed from an enemy submarine on the uninhabited island off Bodrum in the Aegean Sea, were killed in a clash with our gendarmes.

BERLIN, May 5. (Official report this noon.)

Western theater.

The English are retreating with very heavy losses further in the direction of the bridgehead just east of Ypres. The farm of Heule, Eksternest, the castle park of Herenthage, and the farm Het Pappatje fell into our hands. Between Meuse and Moselle, there was again greater activity noted. The French attacked yesterday with strong forces in the Priest's Forest, northwest of Pont-à-Mousson. Despite a long preparation by artillery, the attack was repulsed by our fire with significant losses for the enemy. In contrast, we went on the offensive in the Ailly Forest and east of there, making good progress. So far we have captured 10 officers and 750 men there.

Eastern theater.

Attacks from the southeast on Raszinie were repelled. We are pursuing the enemy. Numerous forward movements of the Russians at Kalvaria, northeast of Suwalki, and east of Augustowo failed as well. In the process, the enemy lost about 500 men as prisoners. In other parts of the front, isolated hand-to-hand combat occurred, all ending in our favor.

Southeastern theater.

Yesterday, north of the Wood Carpathians, the allied armies broke through the third fortified Russian line. Completely defeated on the entire front, the latter are retreating to the Wisloka. The fact that the Russians are beginning to evacuate their positions southwest of Dukla in the Wood Carpathians, which are endangered from the north as a result of the breakthrough by the allies, sufficiently indicates the significance of our victory. Given the speed with which our troops executed this feat of arms, the full extent of the outcome can't yet be precisely described. According to reports received so far, we appear to have captured more than 30,000 prisoners.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 4. The Grand Headquarters reported yesterday: The enemy tried to advance with the left wing to expand the small strip of land they hold near Ariburnu.

BERLIN, 6th May. (Official report of this afternoon.)

Western front. 

Almost along the entire front, there were heavy artillery battles. Near Ypres, we made progress again by capturing the Vanheule Farm and, along the Meesen-Tieperen road. We took a few hundred prisoners and captured 15 machine guns. In the wooded area west of Combres, an attack yielded us 4 officers, 135 men, 4 machine guns, and 1 trench mortar. An attack we launched yesterday in the Ailly Woods achieved its intended goal. The enemy was driven from his position, more than 2,000 Frenchmen, including 21 officers, 2 cannons, several machine guns, and trench mortars fell into our hands. Beyond that, the French suffered significant losses in dead and wounded. North of Flirey and near Croix-des-Carmes, the enemy went on the offensive. North of the first mentioned place, they reached our trenches at one point; the battle is still raging over a small section of them. The French have been repelled elsewhere. North of Steinabrück in the Vosges, an attack on our position was repelled.

Eastern front. 

Southwest of Mitau, south of Szadow, and east of Rossienis, the battles continue. Yesterday, strong Russian forces repeatedly attacked our positions north-east and south-east of Kalvaria throughout the day. All attacks failed with very heavy losses for the enemy. Russian advances towards our bridgehead on the Pilicza had the same outcome. That night, the fortress Grodno was bombed.

Southeastern front. 

In West Galicia, the rearguard of the fleeing enemy tried to offer desperate resistance to the allied armies under the command of General von Mackensen yesterday. However, this was broken with heavy blows on the heights of the left bank of the Wisloka, up and downstream from the Ropomouth. By evening, we had not only advanced across the Wisloka in several places, but we had also captured the road of the Dukla Pass and occupied the village of the same name. In the area east of Tarnow and north up to the Weichsel, fighting continued on the right bank of the Dunajec into the night. So far, we have made more than 40,000 prisoners; one should not lose sight of the fact that this happened during frontal battles. In the Beskid Mountains, on the road of the Lupka Pass, the attacks by the troops under Cavalry General von der Marwitz, and of the Austro-Hungarian army, with which they are closely connected, make good progress.

Eastern front. 

Southwest of Mitau, south of Szadow, and east of Rossienis, the battles continue. Yesterday, strong Russian forces repeatedly attacked our positions north-east and south-east of Kalvaria throughout the day. All attacks failed with very heavy losses for the enemy. Russian advances towards our bridgehead on the Pilicza had the same outcome. That night, the fortress Grodno was bombed.

In West Galicia, the rearguard of the fleeing enemy tried to offer desperate resistance to the allied armies under the command of General von Mackensen yesterday. However, this was broken with heavy blows on the heights of the left bank of the Wisloka, up and downstream from the Ropomouth. By evening, we had not only advanced across the Wisloka in several places, but we had also captured the road of the Dukla Pass and occupied the village of the same name. In the area east of Tarnow and north up to the Weichsel, fighting continued on the right bank of the Dunajec into the night. So far, we have made more than 40,000 prisoners; one should not lose sight of the fact that this happened during frontal battles. In the Beskid Mountains, on the road of the Lupka Pass, the attacks by the troops under Cavalry General von der Marwitz, and of the Austro-Hungarian army, with which they are closely connected, make good progress.

The enemy was driven from his position, more than 2,000 Frenchmen, including 21 officers, 2 cannons, several machine guns, and trench mortars fell into our hands. Beyond that, the French suffered significant losses in dead and wounded. North of Flirey and near Croix-des-Carmes, the enemy went on the offensive. North of the first mentioned place, they reached our trenches at one point; the battle is still raging over a small section of them. The French have been repelled elsewhere. North of Steinabrück in the Vosges, an attack on our position was repelled.

Eastern front. 

Southwest of Mitau, south of Szadow, and east of Rossienis, the battles continue. Yesterday, strong Russian forces repeatedly attacked our positions north-east and south-east of Kalvaria throughout the day. All attacks failed with very heavy losses for the enemy. Russian advances towards our bridgehead on the Pilicza had the same outcome. That night, the fortress Grodno was bombed.

Southeastern front. 

In West Galicia, the rearguard of the fleeing enemy tried to offer desperate resistance to the allied armies under the command of General von Mackensen yesterday. However, this was broken with heavy blows on the heights of the left bank of the Wisloka, up and downstream from the Ropomouth. By evening, we had not only advanced across the Wisloka in several places, but we had also captured the road of the Dukla Pass and occupied the village of the same name. In the area east of Tarnow and north up to the Weichsel, fighting continued on the right bank of the Dunajec into the night. So far, we have made more than 40,000 prisoners; one should not lose sight of the fact that this happened during frontal battles. In the Beskid Mountains, on the road of the Lupka Pass, the attacks by the troops under Cavalry General von der Marwitz, and of the Austro-Hungarian army, with which they are closely connected, make good progress.

Western theatre.

Near Ypres, all the English attempts failed to take hill 60, southeast of Zillebeke, from us, which has been a focal point of battle since April 19. We made some progress further towards Ypres. In these battles, the enemy lost 7 machine guns, 1 trench mortar, and several rifles with ammunition yesterday. New attacks caused the English additional serious losses this morning. Between the Meuse and Moselle, we retained and strengthened the captured terrain on the Meuse hills, as well as southwest and south of the Ailly forest. The French remain at Flirey in a small section of trench of our position: all other attacks were repelled there. Enemy attack attempts north of Steinabruck, in the Fecht valley, were smothered by our fire in their infancy.

Eastern theatre.

The battles south of Szadow and east of Roscinie resulted in a sensitive defeat for the Russians, who suffered heavy losses and lost 1,500 prisoners. They are in full retreat. Southwest of Kalvaria, south of Augustowo, and west of Prasznysch, we bloodily repelled isolated Russian attacks. The enemy lost a total of another 520 prisoners.

Southeastern theatre.
The allied troops achieved a significant victory yesterday in battles on the right bank of the lower Dunajec. The enemy is in hasty retreat to the east there; only a small Russian detachment still holds position on the Vistula. We pushed further southward on the right bank of the Wisloka towards the Wislok and over the Jasielika. At various points, detachments of the right flank of the armies under General von Mackensen already encountered Russian columns, retreating hastily on the Carpathian front, pursued closely by the allies. Our spoils continue to grow steadily.

VIENNA, May 6, 4 p.m.

Enemy attack attempts north of Steinabruck, in the Fecht valley, were smothered by our fire in their infancy.

Eastern theatre.

The battles south of Szadow and east of Roscinie resulted in a sensitive defeat for the Russians, who suffered heavy losses and lost 1,500 prisoners. They are in full retreat. Southwest of Kalvaria, south of Augustowo, and west of Prasznysch, we bloodily repelled isolated Russian attacks. The enemy lost a total of another 520 prisoners.

Southeastern theatre.
The allied troops achieved a significant victory yesterday in battles on the right bank of the lower Dunajec. The enemy is in hasty retreat to the east there; only a small Russian detachment still holds position on the Vistula. We pushed further southward on the right bank of the Wisloka towards the Wislok and over the Jasielika. At various points, detachments of the right flank of the armies under General von Mackensen already encountered Russian columns, retreating hastily on the Carpathian front, pursued closely by the allies. Our spoils continue to grow steadily.

VIENNA, May 6, 4 p.m.

BERLIN, May 8. (Official report from this afternoon.)

Western theater of war.

Last night, our coastal batteries near Zeebrugge sank an enemy destroyer. Along most of the front, the usual artillery skirmishes took place, which increased in intensity at certain points, such as near Ypres, north of Arras, in the Argonne, and on the Meuse Heights. Only in the Vosges did the infantry engage. The French attacked our positions at Steinabrück on both sides of the Fecht valley after long artillery preparation. All attacks failed and cost the enemy heavy losses.

Eastern theater of war:

Our troops advancing on Libau captured the city. In doing so, they took 1,600 Russians prisoner and seized 12 cannons and four machine guns.

Southeastern theater of war.

Yesterday, Mackensen’s army, along with the Austro-Hungarian troops, continued the pursuit of the defeated enemy with vigor. Only some favorable rear-guard skirmishes took place for us. Last evening, our vanguard had already crossed the Wislok near Krosno. As a result of the coordinated actions of all advancing troop units, quite large Russian forces were cut off. Consequently, the number of Russians captured on the Galician front has increased to approximately 70,000 since May 2. We captured 38 cannons, including 9 heavy pieces.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 8. (Report from the Great Headquarters.) On the Dardanelles front, the enemy retains their old position in the south near Ari Burnu. Yesterday morning, supported by the fleet, they launched an attack in the Sedd el Bahr region. The battle continued until late afternoon and was favorable for us. Our counterattacks drove the heavily losing enemy back to their former landing site. On the left flank, some of our forces pursued the enemy to the Sedd el Bahr landing site, raining bombs on the fleeing enemy. In Azerbaijan, around Dilman, small encounters occurred between our reconnaissance units and Russian militias. On the other fronts, nothing of significance occurred.

Last night, our coastal batteries near Zeebrugge sank an enemy destroyer. Along most of the front, the usual artillery skirmishes took place, which increased in intensity at certain points, such as near Ypres, north of Arras, in the Argonne, and on the Meuse Heights. Only in the Vosges did the infantry engage. The French attacked our positions at Steinabrück on both sides of the Fecht valley after long artillery preparation. All attacks failed and cost the enemy heavy losses.

Eastern theater of war:

Our troops advancing on Libau captured the city. In doing so, they took 1,600 Russians prisoner and seized 12 cannons and four machine guns.

Southeastern theater of war.

Yesterday, Mackensen’s army, along with the Austro-Hungarian troops, continued the pursuit of the defeated enemy with vigor. Only some favorable rear-guard skirmishes took place for us. Last evening, our vanguard had already crossed the Wislok near Krosno. As a result of the coordinated actions of all advancing troop units, quite large Russian forces were cut off. Consequently, the number of Russians captured on the Galician front has increased to approximately 70,000 since May 2. We captured 38 cannons, including 9 heavy pieces.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 8. (Report from the Great Headquarters.) On the Dardanelles front, the enemy retains their old position in the south near Ari Burnu. Yesterday morning, supported by the fleet, they launched an attack in the Sedd el Bahr region. The battle continued until late afternoon and was favorable for us. Our counterattacks drove the heavily losing enemy back to their former landing site. On the left flank, some of our forces pursued the enemy to the Sedd el Bahr landing site, raining bombs on the fleeing enemy. In Azerbaijan, around Dilman, small encounters occurred between our reconnaissance units and Russian militias. On the other fronts, nothing of significance occurred.

LIVERPOOL, May 8. (Reuter report.) On Tuesday, a German submarine torpedoed the steamship 'Candidate'; it sank. All the crew were saved.

VIENNA, 10 May. (Official report from yesterday.) Following the driving out of the enemy from their high positions, our columns crossed the border ridge of the Carpathians. Hungary is cleansed of enemies. The battle continues on Galician territory. The enemy retreats over a front of more than 200 kilometers: from the Vistula to the Uzsok Pass. Victorious, the allied armies advanced fighting over the line Uzsok Pass-Komancza-Krosno-Debica-Seczucin. Near the Uzsok Pass in the Carpathian region and on the front in S.E. Galicia, fairly intense battles also broke out. We captured several Russian positions. On the heights northeast of Ottynia, significant enemy forces attacked our troops. The battle is still ongoing there. Yesterday, our troops stormed the heavily fortified bridgehead Zaleszczyki, which the enemy tried to hold in desperate fights for weeks. We pursued the Russians across the Dniester and captured 3,500 of them.

the enemy in Russian Poland south of the
lower Pilica. They have cleared the mountainous area from
Kielce to the upper Kamienna from the enemy and have
advanced along the
Vistula to the heights north of Kłobuck.
On the line Rudnik-Przemyśl,
at the San, the Russian rearguard
was driven from the western bank. Numerous
prisoners remained in our hands. The armies,
coming from the Beskid Carpathians, are continuing
their advance. Yesterday, a strong
Russian rearguard near the Magierówka
heights was defeated. We captured
7 cannons, 11 machine guns, and made
more than 1,000 prisoners. In the morning,
our troops, with music at the head and
cheered by the populace, entered Sambor.
In eastern Galicia, new Russian
attacks north of Kolomyia were repulsed; we
seized a Russian support

It was clear and bright weather.
At 3:10 p.m., it fired a torpedo at the

side, at the height of the command bridge. The
torpedo explosion was immediately followed
by a second, extraordinarily powerful
explosion. The steamship quickly listed to
starboard and began to sink. The
second explosion is attributed to the
detonation of the munitions it had
on board.

yesterday.) The allied troops pursue
the enemy in Russian Poland south of the
lower Pilica. They have cleared the mountainous area from
Kielce to the upper Kamienna from the enemy and have
advanced along the
Vistula to the heights north of Kłobuck.
On the line Rudnik-Przemyśl,
at the San, the Russian rearguard
was driven from the western bank. Numerous
prisoners remained in our hands. The armies,
coming from the Beskid Carpathians, are continuing
their advance. Yesterday, a strong
Russian rearguard near the Magierówka
heights was defeated. We captured
7 cannons, 11 machine guns, and made
more than 1,000 prisoners. In the morning,
our troops, with music at the head and
cheered by the populace, entered Sambor.
In eastern Galicia, new Russian
attacks north of Kolomyia were repulsed; we
seized a Russian support
point once more. Further downstream on the Pruth down to
the national borders, there is relative calm.

BERLIN, May 15. The submarine that
torpedoed the ""Lusitania"" provides the
following account: The submarine
spotted the steamship, which flew no flag,
on May 4, at 2:20 p.m. (Central European Time),
off the southern coast of Ireland.
It was clear and bright weather.
At 3:10 p.m., it fired a torpedo at the
""Lusitania"" and hit the ship on the starboard
side, at the height of the command bridge. The
torpedo explosion was immediately followed
by a second, extraordinarily powerful
explosion. The steamship quickly listed to
starboard and began to sink. The
second explosion is attributed to the
detonation of the munitions it had
on board.

VIENNA, May 22. The government yesterday afternoon handed over to the Italian ambassador, in response to Italy's communication regarding the termination of the Triple Alliance treaty, a reply note, the conclusion of which reads: ""The Imperial and Royal Government cannot take notice of the declaration of the Italian Government by which it claims its complete freedom of action and considers its alliance treaty with Austria-Hungary null and void and no longer in effect. This declaration is clearly contrary to the obligations Italy solemnly entered into by the treaty of December 5, 1912. This treaty established the duration of our alliance until July 8, 1920; stipulated that it had to be denounced one year in advance and provided for neither denunciation nor nullification within this timeframe. Since the Italian government is arbitrarily disregarding all these obligations, the Imperial and Royal Government rejects responsibility for the consequences that might result from this.""

VIENNA, May 23. (Official report from yesterday). In central Galicia, battles continue. The allied troops have retained the territory regained so far, despite all Russian attacks. Our slow-moving operations advance daily. On the Prut front, it is generally quiet. The enemy's attempt to reach the southern bank at Bojan, east of Czernowitz, failed and cost them heavy losses. In the Kielce highlands, the enemy, after stubborn fighting, is retreating further in a northeasterly direction.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 22. The Great Headquarters reports: Yesterday on the Dardanelles front, only weak infantry and artillery skirmishes took place. Two English armored cruisers shelled our infantry positions on the European and Asian coasts. One of these cruisers was hit twice by our coastal batteries, first fled into the bay of Morte and then left the strait. There is nothing to report from the other battlefields.

On the morning of May 23, our artillery inflicted heavy damage on an enemy cruiser off Kaba Tepe; moreover, it was hit by two aerial bombs, so that five warships had to tow it. Yesterday, there were no military operations at Ari Burnu and Sedd-el-Bahr. In the battle at Sedd-el-Bahr on May 22, the enemy lost more than 4,000 men, dead and wounded. Yesterday, the enemy fleet shelled our infantry positions on both sides of the strait entrance; their fire was weak and ineffective. One of our batteries destroyed an enemy battery at Sedd-el-Bahr. Nothing of importance on the other battlefields.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 25. Until now the loss of the Russian armored cruiser of the Black Sea fleet, ""Pantileimon"", was known only through telegrams from abroad. It is now officially reported here that a Turkish submarine sank the armored cruiser. Turkey kept the presence of a submarine in the Black Sea secret until it was revealed by an act of war.

LONDON, May 25. War correspondent John Buchanan reports from the English headquarters to the ""Times"": The enemy possesses an astonishingly powerful weapon. As long as we cannot deploy equally formidable weapons, the superior combat value of our soldiers will avail little. This weapon consists of a large number of machine guns and heavy cannons, as well as what appears to be an inexhaustible supply of ammunition with extraordinary explosive power. The inventor of the fable that the Germans are almost out of stock of ammunition has rendered a disservice to the Allies.

went on the offensive. Yesterday it crossed the Prut
and pushed a significant Russian force southwest
of Kotzmann before it. Otherwise, the situation in the
north remains unchanged.

the Italians from crossing the Isonzo. In the vicinity
of Flitsch and at the Karnkam, to the east of the Plecken Pass,
the battles are still ongoing. In the area of the Tyrolean eastern
border, the cannons still roar incessantly. Our undaunted
cover troops thwarted an attack in the Tonale area.

BERLIN, June 12. (Official report of this afternoon.)

— Western front.

Enemy attacks were repelled in the dunes, northeast of Nieuwpoort, near Mannekensvere, on the eastern slopes of the Loretto heights, and in the area of Souchez. Yesterday, in hand-to-hand combat north of Écurie (Notre-Dame-de-Lorette), the French advanced twice with fresh forces. In the afternoon, we succeeded in completely driving the enemy from our positions; rifle fire thwarted a new French attempt in the evening. The retreating enemy suffered very heavy losses. Near Serre, southeast of Hébuterne, we began an advance from our second position.

— Eastern front.

Near Zoginia and Betygola, on the Dubissa, Russian advances failed. North of Prasnysz, our troops attacked, stormed a Russian position, and captured 150 prisoners, several machine guns, and mortars. At the Rawka, we penetrated an enemy position halfway between Bolimów and Sochaczew. So far, we have taken 500 Russians prisoner there.

— Southeastern front.

East of Przemysl, the situation remains unchanged. The army of General von Linsingen attacked the enemy, who advanced from the north against our flank. We recaptured Zurawno, which had to be evacuated the day before yesterday due to Russian attacks, and pursued the enemy at the bridgeheads near Mszana (northeast of Zurawno) and Zhydachiv. Enemy attacks near Halicz and Stanislau were repelled.

Russian War Theater.

In southeastern Galicia and in Bukovina, the allied armies continue their attack on Russian forces, which still hold out south of the Dniester, with success. Troops under General Pflanzer drove the enemy from his positions near Obertyn and Horodenka, north of Ottynia, and are advancing towards the Dniester. The Russians attempt to maintain themselves on the southern bank of this river. Further east of Czernowitz, the only place where Russians still stand by the Prut, our troops repelled an enemy attack after a brief fight. Elsewhere in the north, there is no change.

Italian War Theater.

The day before yesterday and yesterday, we repelled all Italian attacks on all fronts. The latest assault movement on a section of the bridgehead near Gorizia collapsed under the fire of the Dalmatian homeland defense. North of Ronchi, the enemy had no better luck. On the Isonzo front, the exchange of fire continues. Yesterday afternoon, we repelled a strong attack near Freikofel, on the Carinthian frontier, and a weaker one near the Wolayer Lake. At Peutelstein in Tyrol, an assault movement by an Italian brigade, which had crossed the border near Cortina d'Ampezzo, failed. The last attacks in this area and night battles at Landro also ended with the retreat of the enemy. In the other Tyrolean border areas, continuous exchanges of artillery fire and skirmishes favorable for us have taken place.

VIENNA, June 11. The war correspondent of the ""Neue Freie Presse"" reports from the Tyrolean war theater: In the Tonale area, our troops repelled small enemy attacks everywhere. At each of the Forcelina, Montozzo, and Tonale passes, half of an Italian company was mowed down. At the Paradiso pass, an Alpini battalion of four companies attacked, was repelled with the help of our fortress artillery, and lost at least 100 men. An Italian major and 2 captains were seriously wounded; 2 lieutenants were killed; 2 captains, a doctor, and 30 men remained prisoners in our hands. On our side, we had 3 severely and 3 lightly wounded. An injured Italian shot one of our soldiers, who tried to carry him away, in a treacherous manner.

The latest assault movement on a section of the bridgehead near Gorizia collapsed under the fire of the Dalmatian homeland defense. North of Ronchi, the enemy had no better luck. On the Isonzo front, the exchange of fire continues. Yesterday afternoon, we repelled a strong attack near Freikofel, on the Carinthian frontier, and a weaker one near the Wolayer Lake. At Peutelstein in Tyrol, an assault movement by an Italian brigade, which had crossed the border near Cortina d'Ampezzo, failed. The last attacks in this area and night battles at Landro also ended with the retreat of the enemy. In the other Tyrolean border areas, continuous exchanges of artillery fire and skirmishes favorable for us have taken place.

VIENNA, June 11. The war correspondent of the ""Neue Freie Presse"" reports from the Tyrolean war theater: In the Tonale area, our troops repelled small enemy attacks everywhere. At each of the Forcelina, Montozzo, and Tonale passes, half of an Italian company was mowed down. At the Paradiso pass, an Alpini battalion of four companies attacked, was repelled with the help of our fortress artillery, and lost at least 100 men. An Italian major and 2 captains were seriously wounded; 2 lieutenants were killed; 2 captains, a doctor, and 30 men remained prisoners in our hands. On our side, we had 3 severely and 3 lightly wounded. An injured Italian shot one of our soldiers, who tried to carry him away, in a treacherous manner.

Russian War Theater.

In southeastern Galicia and in Bukovina, the allied armies continue their attack on Russian forces, which still hold out south of the Dniester, with success. Troops under General Pflanzer drove the enemy from his positions near Obertyn and Horodenka, north of Ottynia, and are advancing towards the Dniester. The Russians attempt to maintain themselves on the southern bank of this river. Further east of Czernowitz, the only place where Russians still stand by the Prut, our troops repelled an enemy attack after a brief fight. Elsewhere in the north, there is no change.

Southeast of the Mariampol-Kowno road, fighting against Russian reinforcements coming from the south has again flared up. North of Przasnysz, we captured 150 more prisoners. The Russians launched fruitless night counterattacks on the positions south of Bolimow, from which we had driven them out. The captured positions are firmly in our possession. Our booty at this location amounts to 1,660 prisoners, 8 cannons, including 6 pieces of heavy artillery, 9 machine guns.

We captured 2 officers and a number of soldiers. In the night of June 9 to 10, the enemy tried to attack our right wing at Ari Burnu on the Dardanelles front after midnight; however, he was repelled with heavy losses. During the same night, our fire thwarted an attempt by enemy detachments to approach our left wing at Sedd-ul-Bahr. On the morning of June 11, we destroyed a machine gun covering the enemy's retreat. We saw part of the enemy troops abandon the trenches and flee. On June 11, fire continued intermittently at Sedd-ul-Bahr and at Ari Burnu. Our Anatolian batteries shelled enemy transports, camps, and the landing bridge at Sedd-ul-Bahr on June 10. These batteries also opened a well-directed fire on the enemy artillery west of Hissarlik.

Russian front:

The troops of the army under Pflanzer continue their victorious advance in Southeast Galicia. Yesterday, after fierce battles, they captured Tysmenica, Tlumacz, and the heights north of Olezza. A battle is underway south of Czernelica. New Russian attacks on Zalesczyki were crushed in blood. Our troops who crossed the state borders at Bukovina have driven the Russians from their strong, border-prepared positions. During the pursuit, we occupied several places in Bessarabia and captured 1,560 prisoners yesterday. On the upper Dniester, the allied troops successfully advance towards Zydaczow, where a significant Russian force still holds the southern bank of the Dniester. In Central Galicia, an attack by Austro-Hungarian and German troops resulted in the capture of Sieniawa; after repelling strong enemy attacks, they stormed all support points northeast of the city. Here, 3,500 Russians fell into their hands. Otherwise, the situation remains unchanged. 

Italian front:

In the last two days, there have been rather significant engagements on the Isonzo, namely at Plava. The attempt by the Ravenna Brigade on June 11 to capture the heights of the eastern bank ended with the enemy's retreat. Yesterday morning, the Italians crossed the river again. After a fierce battle, our troops repelled the enemy, who constantly received reinforcements, and held firmly to their positions, before which more than 400 Italian corpses lie. In the Carinthian and Tyrolean border areas, the artillery remains active.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 13.

VIENNA, June 15. (Official report from yesterday.)

Russian front:

The troops of the army under Pflanzer continue their victorious advance in Southeast Galicia. Yesterday, after fierce battles, they captured Tysmenica, Tlumacz, and the heights north of Olezza. A battle is underway south of Czernelica. New Russian attacks on Zalesczyki were crushed in blood. Our troops who crossed the state borders at Bukovina have driven the Russians from their strong, border-prepared positions. During the pursuit, we occupied several places in Bessarabia and captured 1,560 prisoners yesterday. On the upper Dniester, the allied troops successfully advance towards Zydaczow, where a significant Russian force still holds the southern bank of the Dniester. In Central Galicia, an attack by Austro-Hungarian and German troops resulted in the capture of Sieniawa; after repelling strong enemy attacks, they stormed all support points northeast of the city. Here, 3,500 Russians fell into their hands. Otherwise, the situation remains unchanged. 

Italian front:

In the last two days, there have been rather significant engagements on the Isonzo, namely at Plava. The attempt by the Ravenna Brigade on June 11 to capture the heights of the eastern bank ended with the enemy's retreat. Yesterday morning, the Italians crossed the river again. After a fierce battle, our troops repelled the enemy, who constantly received reinforcements, and held firmly to their positions, before which more than 400 Italian corpses lie. In the Carinthian and Tyrolean border areas, the artillery remains active.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 13. The General Headquarters reports: On the Dardanelles front, we repelled the enemy, who repeatedly tried to attack our right wing near Sedd-el-Bahr, with serious losses on the night of June 11 to 12, back to their old positions. On the morning of June 12, the enemy artillery at Ari Burnu fired a large amount of ammunition without achieving the slightest effect. Our Anatolian coastal batteries also successfully targeted the enemy positions yesterday. There is nothing to report from the other fronts.

— Western front.

Yesterday the French suffered another 
defeat. Despite the considerable losses on 
June 13, they continued their breakthrough 
attempt on the Liévin-Arras line with great 
tenacity. Once again, the fire of our brave 
troops stopped the French attacks, which 
were preceded by an extraordinarily fierce 
bombardment, carried out in closed ranks; 
the losses of the enemy are enormous. We 
have not yet managed to retake the trench 
sections that we lost on June 6 northwest of 
Moulin-sous-Touvent (northwest of Soissons). 
North of Perthes and Le Mesnil, in 
Champagne, the battle has flared up again 
here and there; however, the enemy has 
not gained the slightest advantage. 
On Sunday, enemy artillery fired on the 
church of Leflingen, southwest of Ostend, 
during the religious service. Some Belgian 
civilians were injured. Yesterday, an 
enemy squadron dropped bombs on the 
open city of Karlsruhe, which lies entirely 
outside the theater of war and possesses 
no fortifications whatsoever. As far as we 
know so far, 11 civilians were killed and 
6 injured. Of course, there can be no 
question of military damage. One of our 
combat aircraft shot down a plane from 
the enemy squadron. The occupants were 
killed. Another enemy aviator had to 
land near Schirmeck.

Eastern front

West of Szawle, German troops stormed 
and captured the village of Dauksze; they 
then repelled several counterattacks by 2 
to 3 Russian regiments. 4 officers and 1,660 
men were taken prisoner. A significant 
enemy force repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, 
attacked our newly won positions south and 
east of the Mariampol-Kowno road 
yesterday. Our troops went on the attack on 
the Lipowo-Kalwaria front, broke through the 
Russian positions, and captured the foremost 
Russian trenches. On the Orzyc, our troops 
stormed the village of Jednorozec, southeast of 
Chorzele, as well as Czerwona-Gora and 
the bridge to the east of it. The booty at this 
place amounts to 425 prisoners. Enemy 
attack attempts at points of our intrusion 
in their positions near Bolimow failed.

The enemy, defeated in the battle on 
June 13 and 14 by General von Mackensen's 
army, has not succeeded in establishing 
itself in its prepared second position 
northwest of Jaworowo. The enemy was 
pushed back wherever it tried to hold. 
The booty is growing. In view of the 
vigorous pursuit, the Russians must also 
retreat south of the Przemysl-Lemberg 
railway. Troops of General von der Marwitz 
captured Moszisca yesterday. The right 
wing of General von Linsingen's army 
stormed the heights west of Jezupol; his

The troops of Archduke Josef-Ferdinand’s army, after the capture of Sieniawa, began their advance on the eastern bank of the San River towards the north and northeast. Yesterday, the castle and the farm of Piskorowice were stormed, with numerous prisoners falling into our hands. General von Mackensen's army advances amid fierce battles on both sides of Krakowice and towards Oleszyce. The troops under General Boehm-Ermolli, joining the attack, strike the Russians east and southeast of Mosziska, where the enemy in new positions blocks the road to Grodek. South of the upper Dniester, significant Russian forces defend the bridgeheads of Mikolajow, Zydaczow, and Halicz against the allied troops of the army under von Linsingen, while General Pflanzer-Baltin's troops, downstream, stand before Nizniow and Czernelica and hold Zaleszczyki against all Russian attacks. Parts of this army forced the Russians in Bessarabia, between the Dniester and Prut, to retreat once more to Chotin and along the Prut. The number of Russian prisoners from the battles in Galicia since June 12 has increased by a few thousand men yesterday.

Italian battlefield.
The Italians made new, futile attempts to approach our positions near Tolmein and Plava. In some sectors of the Isonzo front, calm prevailed yesterday. The Italians sent a parliamentarian to request a ceasefire to bury the dead, but this request had to be denied for military reasons. Near the Carinthian border, the Styrian militia stormed the Kleine Pal, east of the Ploecken Pass, repelling three counterattacks on this mountain. In the border area of Tyrol, the enemy reconnoiters our positions and continues its futile shelling. At a border point, a watchpost of the imperial guard, without losing a single man, forced an enemy company to retreat and captured 58 Italians.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 14. The Headquarters announces: On the Caucasian front, the enemy attacked yesterday from the direction of Olty. As soon as he was convinced that our troops were meeting him, he hastily retreated and abandoned his positions entirely. We captured them. On the Dardanelles front, two enemy warships, protected by seven torpedo boats, fired a total of 90 shells at some of our positions near Ari Burnu and Sedd-el-Bahr. The effect was nil. The ships soon steamed back to Imbros. On land, only a few cannon and gunshots were exchanged. Our Anatolian batteries fired on the enemy with good effect."""

June 13,Lorette Height,,,"""Announcements from the German General Government. BERLIN, June 16. Official report this afternoon. Western front. As a result of the recent Russian defeats, the French and English attacked yesterday at many points on the western front with significant forces. The English succeeded in pushing back our position north of the Bellewaarde Pond, near Hooge, a little. The battle continues there. Two attacks by four English divisions between the street Estaires-La Bassée and the La Bassée canal failed completely. Our brave Westphalian regiments and parts of the guard brought there repelled the attack after bitter life-or-death fighting. This cost the enemy heavy losses. They left a number of machine guns and a mine thrower in our hands. After their defeats on June 13 and 14 at the Lorette Height, the enemy left our position, which the Badeners defended there with extraordinary stubbornness, untouched this time. At Moulin-sous-Touvent the battle continues. An enemy attempt to break through our lines in the Vosges between the valley of the Fecht and the Lauch failed. Only northwest of Metzeral and at the Hilsenfirst is fighting still taking place. Elsewhere all attacks have already been repelled. Eastern front. In the Davina sector (southeast of Mariampol), east of Augustowo, and north of Bolimow, Russian attacks have been repelled. On the Lipowo-Kalwaria front, we gained some ground again. We have taken some places there. 2,040 prisoners and 3 machine guns fell into our hands. Southeastern front. North of the upper Vistula, the troops under General von Woyrsch repelled the Russian attacks on the positions we took from the enemy on June 14. Yesterday the defeated Russian armies tried to stop the pursuit of the allied armies along the whole front between the San, north of Sieniawa and the swamps of the Dniester, east of Sambor. After a hot fight, they were driven out of all their positions by evening at Kieplice (north of Sieniawa) — southwest of the Lubaszów-Zawadówka sector (southwest of Niemirow) — west of Jaworów — west of Ladowa-Wisznia. We continue the pursuit. General von Mackensen's army has captured more than 40,000 Russians and seized 69 machine guns since June 12.

After a hot fight, they were driven out of all their positions by evening at Kieplice (north of Sieniawa) — southwest of the Lubaszów-Zawadówka sector (southwest of Niemirow) — west of Jaworów — west of Ladowa-Wisznia. We continue the pursuit. General von Mackensen's army has captured more than 40,000 Russians and seized 69 machine guns since June 12. The Russians have gained some ground between the swamps of the Dniester and Zurawno. The overall situation in this place is unchanged. CORRECTION: In the report of June 13, a printing error slipped into the 'Eastern front'. The incursion into the Russian position did not take place south, but indeed north of Bolimow, as could be seen from the report of June 12."""

VIENNA, June 17. (Official report from yesterday.)

Russian battlefield.

The Russians could not stop the general attack of the allied armies in Galicia, despite their most stubborn resistance. The remnants of the defeated Russian army corps retreat, pursued by our victorious troops, over Cewkow, Lubaczow, and Jaworow. South of the Lemberg line, the army of Boehm-Ermolli stormed the Russian positions across the entire front last night and drove the enemy back over Sadowa-Wisznia and Rudki. To the south of the Dniester, fighting is taking place in the areas in front of the bridgeheads. The troops of the army under Pflanzer occupied Nizniow yesterday morning. The battles and fights fought so far in the month of June yielded rich spoils. From June 1st to the 15th, these amounted to a total of: 108 officers, 122,300 lower ranks as prisoners, 53 cannons, 187 machine guns, and 58 ammunition wagons.

Italian battlefield.

The Italians again attempted attacks here and there. However, they were driven back everywhere; this was the case at the Isonzo near Monfalcone, Sagrado, and Plava, in the area east of Plocken (on the border of Carinthia), and near Peutelstein in the Tyrolean border strip.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 15. The headquarters reports: On the Dardanelles front, our artillery positioned opposite Ari Burnu, on the morning of June 13, destroyed the positions the enemy had just built for his mortars and machine gun emplacements. Our well-directed artillery fire caused a fire behind the enemy trenches that lasted half an hour. During the night of June 13 to 14, one of our small reconnaissance patrols penetrated the enemy trenches at Sedd-ul-Bahr, where it captured a machine gun with all its accessories, 15 rifles with bayonets, and a large quantity of cartridges. Yesterday, one of our aviators flew over the islands of Imbros and Lemnos and dropped bombs on an enemy camp on Lemnos. Our coastal batteries yesterday shelled the artillery positions at Sedd-ul-Bahr and the anchorage of the enemy's transport ships. In the course of the same day, an aviator took off over our batteries, to whose well-directed fire he is almost daily exposed; he dropped 7 bombs without causing the slightest damage. From the other battlefields, there is nothing to report.

— Western battlefield.

North of the pond of Bellegarde, we have, for the most part, recaptured the trench sections lost yesterday. The English and French continued their attempts to break through our front.

— North of the La Bassée canal, Westphalians and Saxons overran English troops in hand-to-hand combat and forced them into a rapid retreat to their positions. The French still launched new attacks on the front from west of Liévin to Arras. At the Lorette Heights, we gave up to them a trench totally destroyed by shells. South of Souchez, they succeeded in gaining a footing on a 600-meter front in our position. The battle continues in this place. Everywhere else they were bloodily repulsed. The large amount of ammunition they expended, and their disregard for the enormous losses that their attacks incurred, could not prevent the French and English from suffering another defeat. The life-or-death battles, which ended with our victory, again bear witness to the brilliant bravery and unwavering endurance of our troops. French attacks at Moulin-sous-Touvent also ended unfavorably for the enemy, who lost 5 officers and 300 soldiers as prisoners. In the Vosges, the fierce battles in the Fecht and Lauch valleys also continued yesterday but ended in the evening. Apart from a small loss of ground northwest of Metzeral, all our positions remain in our possession. 100 Evouzvél fell into our hands.

— Eastern battlefield.

Various Russian attacks were repelled. Otherwise, nothing significant to report.

Southeastern battlefield.

The attacks of the allied troops drove the Russians from their positions north of Sieniawa and forced them to retreat to Tarnograd. General von Mackensen’s army is in close pursuit of the enemy. Dachnów and Lubaczów were taken by storm. The southern Smolnik coast was cleared of the enemy. At Niemirów, Russian resistance was soon broken; we crossed the Niemirów-Jaworów road. Further south, the Russians are retreating on the Wereszyca. Southeast of the Dniester marshes, the situation remains unchanged.

— CONSTANTINOPLE, June 16. Headquarters reports: At Ari Burnu, on the Dardanelles front, our artillery opened well-aimed fire. We could observe that our fire caused considerable losses to the enemy at one of their artillery positions.

BERLIN, June 17.

— Western battlefield.

North of the pond of Bellegarde, we have, for the most part, recaptured the trench sections lost yesterday. The English and French continued their attempts to break through our front.

— North of the La Bassée canal, Westphalians and Saxons overran English troops in hand-to-hand combat and forced them into a rapid retreat to their positions. The French still launched new attacks on the front from west of Liévin to Arras. At the Lorette Heights, we gave up to them a trench totally destroyed by shells. South of Souchez, they succeeded in gaining a footing on a 600-meter front in our position. The battle continues in this place. Everywhere else they were bloodily repulsed. The large amount of ammunition they expended, and their disregard for the enormous losses that their attacks incurred, could not prevent the French and English from suffering another defeat. The life-or-death battles, which ended with our victory, again bear witness to the brilliant bravery and unwavering endurance of our troops. French attacks at Moulin-sous-Touvent also ended unfavorably for the enemy, who lost 5 officers and 300 soldiers as prisoners. In the Vosges, the fierce battles in the Fecht and Lauch valleys also continued yesterday but ended in the evening. Apart from a small loss of ground northwest of Metzeral, all our positions remain in our possession. 100 Evouzvél fell into our hands.

The English suffered a new defeat north of the La Bassée canal; their assault troops were mowed down, only a few soldiers could escape by fleeing. The French have penetrated our frontline at a few points east of Angres, south of Souchez, and north of Ecurie. Just north of the Loretto heights, we voluntarily evacuated a section of trench that came under the enfilading fire of the enemy artillery. All other attackers have been repelled. In the combat area north of Arras, since June 16, we have captured 17 officers and 647 men. The bloody losses of the French are comparable to those of the battle in Champagne. In the Argonne forest, we repulsed weak forward movements of the enemy. Near Vauquois, local fighting occurred. In the Vosges, the battles west of Metzeral are still ongoing.

BERLIN, June 18. (Official announcement from this afternoon.)

Western theater of war.

The enemies continue their vain attempts to break through our front north of Arras. The English suffered a new defeat north of the La Bassée canal; their assault troops were mowed down, only a few soldiers could escape by fleeing. The French have penetrated our frontline at a few points east of Angres, south of Souchez, and north of Ecurie. Just north of the Loretto heights, we voluntarily evacuated a section of trench that came under the enfilading fire of the enemy artillery. All other attackers have been repelled. In the combat area north of Arras, since June 16, we have captured 17 officers and 647 men. The bloody losses of the French are comparable to those of the battle in Champagne. In the Argonne forest, we repulsed weak forward movements of the enemy. Near Vauquois, local fighting occurred. In the Vosges, the battles west of Metzeral are still ongoing.

Eastern theater of war.

German cavalry drove advancing Russian detachments back across the Szymsza sector east of the Cytowiany-Szawle road. A strong Russian attack on the Dwina failed.

Southeastern region.

On both sides of Tarnogrod, the allied troops pushed the enemy back to the drainage basin of the Tanew at night. The army under General von Mackensen drove the defeated Russians back into the positions prepared near Grodek (line Narol-Miasto-Nagierow-brook Wereszyca to its mouth in the Dniester). On the Dniester front, the situation northeast of Stryj remains unchanged.

June 21,Front north of Arras,,,"""Communications from the German General-Government.

BERLIN, June 21. (Official report from this afternoon.)

Western front.

On the front north of Arras, the enemy mainly used artillery. Only north of Souchez, an infantry attack followed, which we repelled. The French's nocturnal forward movement towards our position west of Moulin-sous-Touvent, southwest of Soissons, failed. On the western edge of the Argonne, we went on the offensive. Wurttemberg and north German militias stormed, over a front width of 2 kilometers, various consecutive defensive lines and inflicted enormous losses on the French in their futile counter-attack. In this action, we captured 6 officers with 623 men and took 3 machine guns and 3 trench mortars. On the Meuse Heights:

In the evening, the French made 5 vigorous attacks on our positions at Grande Tranchée, west of Les Éparges; all were halted west of the road by our fire. East of the road, the enemy reached points in our position; however, he has already partially been expelled and left 70 prisoners in our hands. Northwest of Lunéville, we had to withdraw our outposts, who held out near Condrexon, for a superior enemy to the main position, northeast of this place. In the Vosges, enemy attacks in the Fecht Valley and south of it were repulsed bloodily. During the night, we voluntarily evacuated Metzeral, which was destroyed by French artillery, to save futile losses.

- Russian front.

The allied troops are at the gates of Zolkiew, near Lemberg, and at the river Szczerzek south of this city. They have attacked the Russians everywhere on this front. The enemy still controls the crossings of the Dniester at Mikolajow and Zydaczow. Troops of the army under Pflanzer have repelled vigorous Russian attacks southwest of Potok and Zloty, near Zaleszczyki, and in the Bessarabian border region, causing immense losses to the enemy. Otherwise, the situation in the northeast is unchanged.

Italian front.

Our brave troops repelled two more Italian attacks during the night of June 20 at Plava. An Italian officer with a white flag, accompanied by a horn blower, appeared before our position to present a request on behalf of his brigade commander. Since these individuals could not prove their capacity as negotiators with a written mandate, they were taken prisoner. In the area northwest of the Krn, the enemy was driven out of his rear position; detachments of the Debrecen Honvéd infantry regiment distinguished themselves notably on this occasion. Our heavy artillery successfully engaged in the mountain battles. Southeast of Plecken, near the Carinthian border, the enemy once again attacked in vain. Nothing significant has happened in the Tyrolean border area. The Italian heavy artillery can do nothing against our forts. On June 19, a torpedo boat successfully shelled the tanks and port installations at Monopoli; on the same day, our seaplanes bombed and damaged stations at Bari and Brindisi.

Southeastern front.

No changes have occurred here recently.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 20. The Headquarters reports: On the Caucasus front, our troops repelled attacks by which the enemy covered his initial retreat. During our counterattacks, we took prisoners and captured 3 machine guns. In the area of Olty, our troops are making progress despite the fierce resistance of the Russians. In these battles, the enemy left 200 corpses on the battlefield, including some officers; prisoners, rifles, tents, and equipment also fell into our hands. On the Dardanelles front, on June 17, our batteries fired on enemy positions for wireless telegraphy and heliostats at Ari Burnu. Most of the enemy soldiers working there were killed. One of our shells inflicted heavy damage on an enemy torpedo boat. On June 18, our artillery successfully bombarded the enemy's left wing, which suffered considerable losses. To escape the deadly fire of our coastal batteries, the enemy took another position. But even here, German batteries soon hurled their shells. The enemy artillery that targeted our infantry was silenced. On the other fronts, the situation is unchanged.

The enemy still controls the crossings of the Dniester at Mikolajow and Zydaczow. Troops of the army under Pflanzer have repelled vigorous Russian attacks southwest of Potok and Zloty, near Zaleszczyki, and in the Bessarabian border region, causing immense losses to the enemy. Otherwise, the situation in the northeast is unchanged.

Italian front.

Our brave troops repelled two more Italian attacks during the night of June 20 at Plava. An Italian officer with a white flag, accompanied by a horn blower, appeared before our position to present a request on behalf of his brigade commander. Since these individuals could not prove their capacity as negotiators with a written mandate, they were taken prisoner. In the area northwest of the Krn, the enemy was driven out of his rear position; detachments of the Debrecen Honvéd infantry regiment distinguished themselves notably on this occasion. Our heavy artillery successfully engaged in the mountain battles. Southeast of Plecken, near the Carinthian border, the enemy once again attacked in vain. Nothing significant has happened in the Tyrolean border area. The Italian heavy artillery can do nothing against our forts. On June 19, a torpedo boat successfully shelled the tanks and port installations at Monopoli; on the same day, our seaplanes bombed and damaged stations at Bari and Brindisi.

Southeastern front.

No changes have occurred here recently.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 20. The Headquarters reports: On the Caucasus front, our troops repelled attacks by which the enemy covered his initial retreat. During our counterattacks, we took prisoners and captured 3 machine guns. In the area of Olty, our troops are making progress despite the fierce resistance of the Russians. In these battles, the enemy left 200 corpses on the battlefield, including some officers; prisoners, rifles, tents, and equipment also fell into our hands. On the Dardanelles front, on June 17, our batteries fired on enemy positions for wireless telegraphy and heliostats at Ari Burnu. Most of the enemy soldiers working there were killed. One of our shells inflicted heavy damage on an enemy torpedo boat. On June 18, our artillery successfully bombarded the enemy's left wing, which suffered considerable losses. To escape the deadly fire of our coastal batteries, the enemy took another position. But even here, German batteries soon hurled their shells. The enemy artillery that targeted our infantry was silenced. On the other fronts, the situation is unchanged.

VIENNA, June 22. (Official.) Our army captured Lemberg today after a fierce battle.

BERLIN, June 21. (Official.) On June 20, one of our submarines attacked a British armored cruiser approximately 100 nautical miles east of the Firth of Forth, which apparently belonged to the Minotaur class. The torpedo hit its target. However, the submarine could not verify the outcome.

COLOGNE, June 21. The ""Cologne People's Newspaper"" reports: The German cardinals von Bettinger (Munich) and von Hartmann (Cologne) have sent the following telegram to the Emperor: ""Outraged by the slander cast by the book 'The German War and Catholicism' on the German fatherland and its glorious army, we cannot refrain from expressing to Your Majesty in the name of the entire German episcopate our deep disappointment about it. We shall consider it our duty to complain to the Head of the Church."" The Archbishop of Cologne received the following reply: ""I thank you and Cardinal Bettinger warmly for the expression of the German episcopate's disappointment regarding the disgraceful literary slander on the German people and army by our enemies. Even such attacks are repulsed by the pure conscience and moral strength with which the German people defend their just cause; they ultimately rebound upon their instigators themselves.""

STOCKHOLM, June 20. The ""Aftonbladet"" sharply expresses the indignation of the Swedish people over the dropping of bombs by aircraft on the castle in Karlsruhe, where the Queen of Sweden was staying. It was a deliberate attack on a royal residence inhabited only by women and children, says the paper. The audacity that led the French military command to spare not even the childhood home of the Swedish Queen gives substance for reflection in Sweden. Such a deed, the paper further says, is neither chivalrous nor in keeping with the view that Sweden had of the French character. The ""Daily General"" reports that the people have decided to honor the Queen, as a sign of joy and gratitude for her escape from this danger, in a particularly splendid manner upon her return to Sweden.

Western theatre of war.

On the western canal bank, we repelled attacks on farms we occupied northwest of Dixmude. North of Arras, artillery battles were intense yesterday. Around midnight, we repelled a French assault in the maze south of Neuville. After successful mine explosions west of Perthes in Champagne, we advanced our position slightly. On the Meuse hills, hand-to-hand fights lasted all day under intense cannon fire. Around three o'clock this morning, we counterattacked, nearly completely clearing our trenches of the enemy, taking 130 prisoners. A weak attack attempt at Marcheville was thwarted. In the area east of Lunéville, outpost skirmishes at Lemetrey developed again. In the Vosges, we voluntarily withdrew to east of Sondernach, on the eastern bank of the Fecht, without being harassed by the enemy. New attacks near the Hilsenfirst heights inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. Our aircraft dropped bombs on the airfield near Courcelles, west of Reims. Enemy aircraft bombs did no military damage in either Bruges or Ostend.

CONSTANTINOPLE, 21 June. The General Headquarters reports: On the Dardanelles front, there was an exchange of light artillery and rifle fire yesterday at Ari Burnu. In the afternoon, our fire halted an enemy attack on our left wing at Sedd-el-Bahr. The enemy had to flee back to their trenches with significant losses. A general assault on our front at Sedd-el-Bahr was also repelled this morning. Our Anatolian coastal batteries once again successfully shelled enemy destroyers, minesweepers, artillery, supply trains, ammunition depots, and aircraft sheds; they destroyed one enemy aircraft and damaged another. In response, the enemy dropped over 30 bombs on these batteries, causing no damage. On the other fronts, the situation remained unchanged."

Western theatre of war.

On the western canal bank, we repelled attacks on farms we occupied northwest of Dixmude. North of Arras, artillery battles were intense yesterday. Around midnight, we repelled a French assault in the maze south of Neuville. After successful mine explosions west of Perthes in Champagne, we advanced our position slightly. On the Meuse hills, hand-to-hand fights lasted all day under intense cannon fire. Around three o'clock this morning, we counterattacked, nearly completely clearing our trenches of the enemy, taking 130 prisoners. A weak attack attempt at Marcheville was thwarted. In the area east of Lunéville, outpost skirmishes at Lemetrey developed again. In the Vosges, we voluntarily withdrew to east of Sondernach, on the eastern bank of the Fecht, without being harassed by the enemy. New attacks near the Hilsenfirst heights inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. Our aircraft dropped bombs on the airfield near Courcelles, west of Reims. Enemy aircraft bombs did no military damage in either Bruges or Ostend.

Yesterday we shelled the fortress of Dunkirk, as well as the enemy troop concentrations at the towns of St.-Winoksbergen, Hondschoote, Fournes, and Kassel. From Givenchy to north of the La Bassée canal and at Neuville, our artillery suppressed enemy attacks in the bud. Our trench warfare is making good progress south of Souchez. On the Meuse Heights, the French continue their breakthrough attempts without achieving even the slightest advantage; moreover, their fruitless attacks cost them serious losses. So far, we have taken 280 unharmed Frenchmen, including 8 officers, as prisoners and captured 80 machine guns along with 20 mortars. East of Lunéville, the outpost engagements are still ongoing. In the Vosges, we stormed the height 631 near Ban de Sapt, which dominates the area and has been fiercely contested for months. Here we captured 193 prisoners, 3 machine guns, 1 mortar, and much other equipment. The enemy vainly attempted to retake this position. South of Neuville, one of our aviators shot down an enemy aircraft.

Western front

Yesterday we shelled the fortress of Dunkirk, as well as the enemy troop concentrations at the towns of St.-Winoksbergen, Hondschoote, Fournes, and Kassel. From Givenchy to north of the La Bassée canal and at Neuville, our artillery suppressed enemy attacks in the bud. Our trench warfare is making good progress south of Souchez. On the Meuse Heights, the French continue their breakthrough attempts without achieving even the slightest advantage; moreover, their fruitless attacks cost them serious losses. So far, we have taken 280 unharmed Frenchmen, including 8 officers, as prisoners and captured 80 machine guns along with 20 mortars. East of Lunéville, the outpost engagements are still ongoing. In the Vosges, we stormed the height 631 near Ban de Sapt, which dominates the area and has been fiercely contested for months. Here we captured 193 prisoners, 3 machine guns, 1 mortar, and much other equipment. The enemy vainly attempted to retake this position. South of Neuville, one of our aviators shot down an enemy aircraft. What the French official report states about the capture of a German trench southwest of St-Joris by the Belgians is completely fabricated.

Yesterday we shelled the fortress of Dunkirk, as well as the enemy troop concentrations at the towns of St.-Winoksbergen, Hondschoote, Fournes, and Kassel. From Givenchy to north of the La Bassée canal and at Neuville, our artillery suppressed enemy attacks in the bud. Our trench warfare is making good progress south of Souchez. On the Meuse Heights, the French continue their breakthrough attempts without achieving even the slightest advantage; moreover, their fruitless attacks cost them serious losses. So far, we have taken 280 unharmed Frenchmen, including 8 officers, as prisoners and captured 80 machine guns along with 20 mortars. East of Lunéville, the outpost engagements are still ongoing. In the Vosges, we stormed the height 631 near Ban de Sapt, which dominates the area and has been fiercely contested for months. Here we captured 193 prisoners, 3 machine guns, 1 mortar, and much other equipment. The enemy vainly attempted to retake this position. South of Neuville, one of our aviators shot down an enemy aircraft. What the French official report states about the capture of a German trench southwest of St-Joris by the Belgians is completely fabricated.

Eastern front

Nothing new.

Southeastern front

Austrian troops stormed and captured Lemberg yesterday afternoon, as well as the connecting Szczerek position from near Mikolajow, on the Dniester, to Lemberg. Further north, pursuing troops occupied the line Zoltance-Turynka (northeast of Zolkiew) east of Lemberg. Near Ravaruska and to the west of it, the situation remains unchanged. The Russians are retreating in the San and Vistula regions, as well as to the left of the Vistula.

VIENNA, 25 June. (Official report of yesterday.)

Russian battlefield.

In Eastern Galicia, the general situation has not changed. East and northeast of Lemberg, strong Russian rear guards are being fought. At the Dniester, Mikolajow and Zydaczow were captured. Downstream from this last city, the allied troops, in stubborn battles, have reached the northern bank of the Dniester at several locations. The enemy is retreating further between the Vistula and San. North of the Vistula, Russian rear guards were pushed back to beyond Amienna. Our troops have occupied Ores and Sandomierz.

Italian battlefield.

Our troops repelled an attack by a significant Italian force near the Klemen Pass, on the Carinthian border. Otherwise, military operations here and on the Tyrolean border were limited to artillery skirmishes. Calm prevails in the Krn area. At the Isonzo, a fierce artillery battle is raging. At Gradisca and Monfalcone, the Italians stormed in vain.

CONSTANTINOPLE, 23 June. The General Headquarters reports: Our troops, operating in the direction of Olty, launched numerous attacks and pushed the strong Russian right wing located there further east. As a result, important enemy positions and rich booty fell into our hands. Recently captured Russians stated that in Russia, men aged 50 are already being called to arms and equipped with Berdan rifles, and that the new recruits, as well as the population of more than one area, have opposed the war. On the Dardanelles front, the enemy repeatedly attacked our southern position near Sedd-el-Bahr on the morning of 21 June. He was aided by his heavy-caliber artillery and the recently arrived reinforcements; these attacks, which continued until midnight, completely failed nevertheless. The enemy was driven back to his old positions with enormous losses. On 20 June, a section of our batteries north of Ari Burnu damaged two large enemy transport ships patrolling in this area; as a result, they were forced to withdraw. On the morning of 21 June, our artillery fire destroyed a gun emplacement the enemy was fortifying. From the other fronts, there is nothing special to report.

BERLIN, 24 June. On 22 May, a German aircraft in the Baltic Sea, 25 nautical miles east of Gotland, bombed a Russian submarine, presumably of the Akula-type. At the time, it could not be determined if it was hit; but now it is admitted from the Russian side that the submarine is lost."

VIENNA, 25 June. (Official report of yesterday.)

Russian battlefield.

In Eastern Galicia, the general situation has not changed. East and northeast of Lemberg, strong Russian rear guards are being fought. At the Dniester, Mikolajow and Zydaczow were captured. Downstream from this last city, the allied troops, in stubborn battles, have reached the northern bank of the Dniester at several locations. The enemy is retreating further between the Vistula and San. North of the Vistula, Russian rear guards were pushed back to beyond Amienna. Our troops have occupied Ores and Sandomierz.

Italian battlefield.

Our troops repelled an attack by a significant Italian force near the Klemen Pass, on the Carinthian border. Otherwise, military operations here and on the Tyrolean border were limited to artillery skirmishes. Calm prevails in the Krn area. At the Isonzo, a fierce artillery battle is raging. At Gradisca and Monfalcone, the Italians stormed in vain.

CONSTANTINOPLE, 23 June. The General Headquarters reports: Our troops, operating in the direction of Olty, launched numerous attacks and pushed the strong Russian right wing located there further east. As a result, important enemy positions and rich booty fell into our hands. Recently captured Russians stated that in Russia, men aged 50 are already being called to arms and equipped with Berdan rifles, and that the new recruits, as well as the population of more than one area, have opposed the war. On the Dardanelles front, the enemy repeatedly attacked our southern position near Sedd-el-Bahr on the morning of 21 June. He was aided by his heavy-caliber artillery and the recently arrived reinforcements; these attacks, which continued until midnight, completely failed nevertheless. The enemy was driven back to his old positions with enormous losses. On 20 June, a section of our batteries north of Ari Burnu damaged two large enemy transport ships patrolling in this area; as a result, they were forced to withdraw. On the morning of 21 June, our artillery fire destroyed a gun emplacement the enemy was fortifying. From the other fronts, there is nothing special to report.

BERLIN, 25 June. (Official report of this afternoon.)

Western theater of war.

South of Souchez, we captured some machine guns in hand-to-hand combat. Repeated enemy forward movements on our Labyrinth position were thwarted. On the western edge of the Argonne forest, a French battalion unsuccessfully attacked our new front positions and suffered serious losses in the process. In the counter-attack, we captured another trench along with two blockhouses; 8 machine guns and 3 mine launchers fell into our hands. On the Meuse Heights, the French attacks west of the Trench failed completely. East of the Trench, we recaptured a communication trench, which the enemy defended to the utmost. At Leintrey, east of Luneville, we repelled enemy ventures of little importance.

Eastern theater of war.

The village of Kopaczyska, which has been in our possession since the day before yesterday, has been relinquished again. Southeast of Chorzele, our troops captured part of the enemy’s position after fierce hand-to-hand combat near the village of Stegna and entrenched themselves there.

Southeastern theater of war.

The troops of General von Woyrsch are pursuing the Russians beyond the wooded area east of Hza. Essentially, the situation with Field Marshal von Mackensen's armies remains unchanged. Northwest of Halicz, parts of the army under von Linsingen had to retreat to the southern bank of the Dniester at Martinow due to counter-attacks by a superior enemy. Further upstream, our offensive is making good progress. The left wing of this army is positioned at Chodorow.

CONSTANTINOPLE, 25 June. The Headquarters reports on 24 June: On the Caucasus front, one of our detachments, in a counter-attack on the morning of 23 June near Kaleboghaz, pushed the enemy rear guard back. The enemy retreated to Kaleboghaz. On the Dardanelles front, there were intermittent, weak artillery and infantry skirmishes yesterday near Sedd-ul-Bahr and Ari Burnu. On the other fronts, the situation is unchanged.

LONDON, 24 June.

BERLIN, 25 June. (Official report of this afternoon.)

Western theater of war.

South of Souchez, we captured some machine guns in hand-to-hand combat. Repeated enemy forward movements on our Labyrinth position were thwarted. On the western edge of the Argonne forest, a French battalion unsuccessfully attacked our new front positions and suffered serious losses in the process. In the counter-attack, we captured another trench along with two blockhouses; 8 machine guns and 3 mine launchers fell into our hands. On the Meuse Heights, the French attacks west of the Trench failed completely. East of the Trench, we recaptured a communication trench, which the enemy defended to the utmost. At Leintrey, east of Luneville, we repelled enemy ventures of little importance.

Eastern theater of war.

The village of Kopaczyska, which has been in our possession since the day before yesterday, has been relinquished again. Southeast of Chorzele, our troops captured part of the enemy’s position after fierce hand-to-hand combat near the village of Stegna and entrenched themselves there.

Southeastern theater of war.

The troops of General von Woyrsch are pursuing the Russians beyond the wooded area east of Hza. Essentially, the situation with Field Marshal von Mackensen's armies remains unchanged. Northwest of Halicz, parts of the army under von Linsingen had to retreat to the southern bank of the Dniester at Martinow due to counter-attacks by a superior enemy. Further upstream, our offensive is making good progress. The left wing of this army is positioned at Chodorow.

CONSTANTINOPLE, 25 June. The Headquarters announces: On the Caucasus front, the artillery battle with the enemy rearguards continued on June 24 in the mountain region near Kale Boghasi. A small skirmish took place in the area of Marman Boghasi. On the Dardanelles front, the guns thundered at Ari Burnu with intermittent fire during the night of June 25. At Sedd-ul-Bahr, the situation has remained unchanged since the last battle in which the enemy was driven back to his old positions. Since then, he has undertaken no movements of any significance. So far, we have not been able to even approximately determine the extraordinarily large losses of the enemy in the battle of June 21. Our artillery does not fire on the hospital ships that are continuously evacuating the wounded. On the night of June 25, one of our reconnaissance patrols from the right flank surprised an enemy unit in a trench at Sedd-ul-Bahr, destroyed it, destroyed the machine guns, and returned with 26 rifles, 9 boxes of ammunition, engineering materials, spare parts for machine guns, telephone equipment, and bombs as booty.

The hand-to-hand combat, which had been raging for days without cease to oust the enemy from our positions, those he occupied north of Souchez and halfway between Souchez and Neuville, has ended. Last night the last French were driven out of our trenches. Last evening the enemy still attempted significant reinforcements to attack, both on either side of the Lorette heights and south of Souchez; but in vain. At Souain in Champagne, we partially blew up the enemy positions; east of Perthes, the French themselves destroyed a portion of their own positions due to unsuccessful mine detonations. West of Combres on the Meuse heights, fierce fighting occurred. On both sides of the Trench, the French attacked four times and always with fresh troops over a front breadth of about 3 kilometers. Each time they were halted by our fire. Where the enemy reached our trenches, they were beaten back with great losses in hand-to-hand combat. A counterattack led to the capture of an advanced enemy position west of the Trench; there the enemy still holds a small section of trench he conquered on June 20. The enemy made a few fruitless attacks on our outposts at Leintrey east of Lunéville. Since the first day of the great battle at Arras, our aviators have been contesting the enemy's air supremacy. Both sides have made sacrifices. Ours were not in vain: for several days we have achieved good success.

Both sides have made sacrifices. Ours were not in vain: for several days we have achieved good success.

Eastern theater of war.

Württemberg regiments stormed some Russian positions south-east of Oglenda, north of Prasnyscz, and on both sides of the Murawka brook and maintained their positions, despite several, also strong, counterattacks. The spoils consist of 636 prisoners and 4 machine guns.

- Southeastern theater of war.

The army of General von Linsingen is making good progress on the northern bank of the Dniester. At Halicz, the enemy still occupies the right bank. Since the start of his attack across this river on June 23, this army has taken 3,500 prisoners. Between the Dniester and the area east of Lemberg, the pursuit continues.

'Western theater of war.

The hand-to-hand combat, which had been raging for days without cease to oust the enemy from our positions, those he occupied north of Souchez and halfway between Souchez and Neuville, has ended. Last night the last French were driven out of our trenches. Last evening the enemy still attempted significant reinforcements to attack, both on either side of the Lorette heights and south of Souchez; but in vain. At Souain in Champagne, we partially blew up the enemy positions; east of Perthes, the French themselves destroyed a portion of their own positions due to unsuccessful mine detonations. West of Combres on the Meuse heights, fierce fighting occurred. On both sides of the Trench, the French attacked four times and always with fresh troops over a front breadth of about 3 kilometers. Each time they were halted by our fire. Where the enemy reached our trenches, they were beaten back with great losses in hand-to-hand combat.
