A TRUE STORY.

How to get rid of an annoying journalist.

"The reign of terror that the cruel Germans have introduced in unfortunate Belgium for almost nine months now has found a new victim in Mr. Joset, a newspaper administrator from the province of Luxembourg, a man of great merit who played an important political role in his province immediately before the war.

From the moment of the occupation of Belgium, the German military authority put Mr. Joset on the list of suspicious individuals who had to be supervised closely. He remained cautious, knowing that the Germans would take the smallest pretext to arrest him, accuse him of espionage, and make him share the fate of so many of his unfortunate compatriots who have fallen under Prussian bullets.

Weeks and months went by. The Germans waited in vain for the opportunity, which simply would not arise, to 'settle the matter' of this courageous yet cautious and prudent man. Therefore, they decided to resort to one of those cowardly and despicable methods with which they know how to deal masterfully.

About a month ago, Mr. Joset planned to go to the Netherlands. He traveled to Arlon, where he went to ask for a pass from the captain in charge of the Kommandantur. The captain received Mr. Joset in his office very politely; after examining his papers, he promised him a pass. Then suddenly, he stood up and said:

— Excuse me a moment; I need to issue an order; I will be right at your disposal.

He left and let Mr. Joset alone in the office. A little later, he returned, sat at his desk, and signed the visitor's pass.

— Where is the seal of the Kommandantur? he suddenly shouted, and he threw the papers piled up in front of him into disorder.

— The seal has disappeared! he bellowed, you stole it!

And he leaped at Mr. Joset; two gendarmes rushed at his call. The prisoner was searched while his arms were held. And—how could it be otherwise?—the seal appeared, or rather a gendarme pulled it from one of the outer pockets of the poor Belgian journalist.

It does no good for him to shout, to protest, it is in vain! He was arrested and brought in chains to the prison of Arlon. At the same time, a house search was ordered at Mr. Joset's residence. There too, they discovered—as only the Germans could find—a secret cipher; they also "discovered" the draft of a cipher message, which was immediately deciphered with the cipher key and contained important military information destined for the allied army commanders!

The matter is settled! A few days after his arrest, Mr. Joset appeared before the German court-martial and was sentenced to death for high treason!

This sentence caused a great stir among the population. Immediately, a petition began circulating, adorned with hundreds of signatures, pleading for clemency for the condemned. This courageous act by the population impressed the executioners, and they did not dare to carry out the sentence. The death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment."

The "Matin", which does not even know the real name of its protégé—how characteristic—proves once again that it no longer wishes to be counted among the newspapers with which well-bred people prefer to be associated.

We establish the following only to clearly and explicitly denounce the pitiable attack on the German judicial system:

In the case, where the Belgian journalist Kamiel Joset from Arlon was sentenced, on April 15, 1915, to 3 years in prison for stealing an official seal and to death for espionage, the first offense played only a subordinate role. The fact that Joset provided secret information about German troop movements to a hostile state, which he openly admitted in all detail both during the interrogation and in his clemency appeal to the Governor-General, was decisive. As an aggravating circumstance, it was also taken into consideration that the convict enjoyed special trust from the German authorities, benefited from extensive privileges as a result, and precisely this trust was betrayed in a disgraceful manner by secretly planning a trip to France. If the death sentence was nevertheless commuted to life imprisonment through a pardon, the convicted man owes this solely to the fact that he showed sincere remorse for his crime and that from the beginning of the war he had been able to make himself very useful for the public welfare.

With this, we leave it to everyone's sense of justice to form a judgment on the malicious means by which the honor of German officers and officials is smeared.

A TRUE STORY.

How to get rid of a troublesome journalist.

"The reign of terror that the cruel Germans have now imposed for nearly nine months in unfortunate Belgium has found a new victim in the person of Mr. Joset, a newspaper editor from the province of Luxembourg, a man of great merit who played a significant political role in his province up until the outbreak of war.

From the moment of the occupation of Belgium, the German military authority listed Mr. Josen among the suspicious persons who needed to be specially monitored. He remained on guard, knowing well that the Germans would seize any opportunity to arrest him, accuse him of espionage, and let him share the fate of so many unfortunate fellow citizens who have fallen under Prussian bullets.

Weeks and months passed. The Germans waited in vain for an opportunity that never came to "settle the matter" with this courageous yet cautious and prudent man. So they decided to resort to one of those cowardly and dastardly methods with which they know how to handle masterfully.

About a month ago, Mr. Josen planned to go to the Netherlands. He traveled to Arlon, where he asked the captain in charge of the Kommandantur for a pass. The captain received Mr. Josen at his office very politely; after examining his papers, he promised to give him a pass. Then he suddenly stands up and says:

"Pardon me for a moment; I need to go give an order; I'll be right back at your service."

He leaves and lets Mr. Josen alone in the office. A little later, he returns, sits at his desk, and signs the visitor's pass.

"Where is the Kommandantur's stamp?" he suddenly shouts and throws the papers piled in front of him all over.

"The stamp is missing!" he roars. "You have stolen it!"

And he throws himself on Mr. Josen; two gendarmes quickly join him at his call. The prisoner is searched while his arms are held. And - how could it be otherwise? - the stamp was found, or rather a gendarme pulled it out from one of the outer pockets of the poor Belgian journalist.

He protests and shouts in vain! He is arrested and led in chains to the Arlon prison. At the same time, a search of Mr. Josen's house is ordered. And there, as only the Germans can find, a secret cipher code is discovered; they also "discover" the draft of a cipher telegram, which is immediately deciphered with the key, containing important military information destined for the allied command!

The matter is settled! A few days after his arrest, Mr. Josen appears before the German court-martial and is sentenced to death for high treason!

We state the following solely to clearly highlight the pitifulness of its attack on the German judicial system:

In the trial where the Belgian journalist Camille Joset from Arlon was sentenced on April 15, 1915, for the theft of an official stamp to three years in prison and for espionage to death, the first offense played only a subordinate role. The fact that Joset provided secret information about German troop movements to a hostile state, which he openly admitted in all detail during his interrogation and in the clemency plea addressed to the Herr Generalgouverneur, was decisive. As an aggravating circumstance, it was also taken into account that the convict enjoyed special trust from the German authorities, as a result of which he enjoyed sweeping judgments, and that he abused this trust in a disgraceful manner by secretly planning a trip to France. If the imposed death sentence was nonetheless commuted to life penal servitude through clemency, the convict owes it solely to the fact that he showed sincere remorse for his crime and that from the beginning of the war, he managed to render significant services for the general welfare.

We leave it to everyone's sense of justice to form an opinion on the venomous means with which the honor of German officers and officials is sullied.

"Announcements from the German General Government. Daily German report. BERLIN, May 1st. (Official report from this afternoon.) Western Front. The battles on the western bank of the canal to the northwest of Ypres, which we mentioned yesterday, ended in a very costly defeat for the enemy. To the east of the canal, north of Ypres, he made futile attacks. The bombardment of the fortress of Dunkirk continues. Between the Meuse and the Moselle, infantry battles only took place in the area of Ailly and Apremont. All French attacks failed and cost the enemy very heavy losses. In response to the shelling of our rest areas behind the front, we launched several shells into Reims on April 29th. The enemy can easily avoid a bombardment of Reims, as he is well aware of the reason for our actions. Yesterday, the enemy again lost three aircraft. To the northwest of Thielt, an English aircraft was shot down; another aircraft was brought down and destroyed by our fire near Wieltje, northwest of Ypres. The third, which was part of an enemy squadron, had to land at Nieder-Sulzbach.

Eastern Front. The battle at Szawla ended in our favor. The enemy, who suffered heavy losses, fled in the direction of Nitau after setting Szawla on fire in four places. The pursuit continues. So far, we have captured 1,000 prisoners and seized ten machine guns, large quantities of goods, ammunition wagons, and especially a lot of ammunition. Enemy attacks at Kalvaria and to the southwest of there were repelled with significant losses for the Russians. Here we captured another 350 men. However, the Russians succeeded in overrunning a German outpost company southwest of Augustowo at night and inflicted severe losses. East of Plock and on the southern bank of the Pilica, we repelled weak Russian attacks.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 1st. On April 30th, at 5:25 p.m., the Headquarters reports: At Kaba Tepe and Gallipoli, the enemy attempted to escape from the narrow strip of land on which he was trapped. However, we thwarted his attempts and forced him back to within 500 meters of the coastline, where he found protection from his fleet. We inflicted extraordinarily heavy losses on him. We completely thwarted an enemy attempt to land troops in the Gulf of Saros under the protection of part of his fleet. From the other battlefields, there is nothing significant to report.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 1st. It is reported from Erzerum: For three days, battles between scouts have been taking place south of Artvin. The enemy was repulsed everywhere with heavy losses. After a two-hour battle, the Russians retreated eastward.

Western Theater of War.

- In Flanders, we successfully launched attacks on both sides of the Poelkappelle-Ypres road and captured the farms "The Fortune", southeast of St. Julian. In Champagne, our well-executed mine explosions caused significant damage to the enemy position between Souain and Perthes. Between the Meuse and Moselle, only artillery was active yesterday. At Hartmannswillerkopf, the French unsuccessfully attempted to attack our position on the summit last night. Yesterday, a French aircraft landed at Hundlingen, west of Sargemund; both occupants were captured. A German aircraft squadron successfully attacked, evidently, the aircraft hangar and the station of Epinal.

Eastern Theater of War.

In the pursuit of the Russians fleeing towards Riga, we captured 4 cannons, 4 machine guns, and took 1,700 prisoners south of Mitau yesterday. This brings the total number of prisoners to 3,200. Southwest of Kalvaria, Russian attacks failed with heavy losses for the enemy: the Russians were driven back over the Scesupa and left 330 prisoners in our hands. The Russians also suffered a severe defeat northeast of Skierniewice: in addition to numerous dead, they lost 100 men as prisoners.

Southeastern Theater of War.

In the presence of the supreme commander, Field Marshal Archduke Friedrich, and under the leadership of General von Mackensen, the allied troops broke through the entire Russian front in Western Galicia yesterday after bitter battles, from near the Hungarian border to the mouth of the Dunajec in the Vistula, and pushed it back everywhere. The enemy troops that could escape are being closely pursued by the allied armies in full retreat to the east. The spoils of victory cannot yet be estimated, even approximately.

BERLIN, May 4. (Official report from
this afternoon.)

Western theatre of war.

In Flanders, we continue our attacks in the North and in
the East with very good success. This morning Seven-
kot, Zonnebeke, Westhoek, the Polygon Wood,
and Nonne Bosschen — possession of which
was fought over fiercely for months —
fell into our hands. The retreating enemy stands
north and south of Ypres in the firing
line of our batteries. In the Argonne,
the French unsuccessfully attempted to recapture a trench
north of Le Four de Paris, which we took on May 1. Yesterday,
the artillery battles between the Meuse
and the Moselle continued.

Eastern theatre of war.

The number of captured Russians in the pursuit towards Mitau has risen
above 4,000. New Russian attacks southwest of Kalvaria were
repulsed; 170 prisoners remained in our
hands. Russian attacks also failed southeast of Augustowo,
where the enemy suffered heavy losses and in addition lost 4 officers
with 420 men as prisoners and
8 machine guns. Near Jedwabno,
northeast of Lomza, we likewise repelled
a Russian night attack.

Southeastern theatre of war.

The general attack between the Boskowitz valley
and Upper Vistula went well.
For the first day, the spoils amount to
21,500 prisoners, 16 cannons, 47 ma-
chine guns and various war materials,
which cannot yet be determined.

VIENNA, May 4. (Official report from
today.) The allied German and Austro-
Hungarian troops have achieved a new victory
in loyal comradeship. Since the Russian retreat, after
our victory at Limanowa in West
Galicia, we have conquered the very fortified
enemy front between the Vistula and the
main ridge of the Carpathians, over its entire
extent. In the continued attack,
Austro-Hungarian and German forces achieved new advantages
on the whole front yesterday, in the presence of the supreme
commander, Field Marshal Archduke
Friedrich. Unstoppably, they advanced further eastward and repeatedly forced significant Russian
forces to a swift retreat. The outcome
of this battle also cannot yet be determined. So far, we have
counted more than 30,000 prisoners, and their number
increases by the hour. In the numerous captured
Russian positions, we seized a
large amount of war material. 22 pieces
of artillery and 64 machine guns belong
to the first spoils. On all other fronts,
the general situation is unchanged.

BERLIN, May 5. (Official report this noon.)

Western theater.

The English are retreating with very heavy losses further in the direction of the bridgehead just east of Ypres. The farm of Heule, Eksternest, the castle park of Herenthage, and the farm Het Pappatje fell into our hands. Between Meuse and Moselle, there was again greater activity noted. The French attacked yesterday with strong forces in the Priest's Forest, northwest of Pont-à-Mousson. Despite a long preparation by artillery, the attack was repulsed by our fire with significant losses for the enemy. In contrast, we went on the offensive in the Ailly Forest and east of there, making good progress. So far we have captured 10 officers and 750 men there.

Eastern theater.

Attacks from the southeast on Raszinie were repelled. We are pursuing the enemy. Numerous forward movements of the Russians at Kalvaria, northeast of Suwalki, and east of Augustowo failed as well. In the process, the enemy lost about 500 men as prisoners. In other parts of the front, isolated hand-to-hand combat occurred, all ending in our favor.

Southeastern theater.

Yesterday, north of the Wood Carpathians, the allied armies broke through the third fortified Russian line. Completely defeated on the entire front, the latter are retreating to the Wisloka. The fact that the Russians are beginning to evacuate their positions southwest of Dukla in the Wood Carpathians, which are endangered from the north as a result of the breakthrough by the allies, sufficiently indicates the significance of our victory. Given the speed with which our troops executed this feat of arms, the full extent of the outcome can't yet be precisely described. According to reports received so far, we appear to have captured more than 30,000 prisoners.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 4. The Grand Headquarters reported yesterday: The enemy tried to advance with the left wing to expand the small strip of land they hold near Ariburnu. We threw them back through our counterattacks with considerable losses into the very rocky valleys and then drove them towards the coast. At the same time, our batteries set an enemy transport ship on fire. The other transport ships, which were near the coast, fled in haste. The battleship "Agamemnon," which attempted to shell Bulair indirectly, was hit by four shells yesterday. It withdrew as it could no longer respond to our fire. Seven armed sailors and an officer, who had landed from an enemy submarine on the uninhabited island off Bodrum in the Aegean Sea, were killed in a clash with our gendarmes. There is nothing important to report from the other fronts.

BERLIN, 6th May. (Official report of this afternoon.)

Western front. 

Almost along the entire front, there were heavy artillery battles. Near Ypres, we made progress again by capturing the Vanheule Farm and, along the Meesen-Tieperen road. We took a few hundred prisoners and captured 15 machine guns. In the wooded area west of Combres, an attack yielded us 4 officers, 135 men, 4 machine guns, and 1 trench mortar. An attack we launched yesterday in the Ailly Woods achieved its intended goal. The enemy was driven from his position, more than 2,000 Frenchmen, including 21 officers, 2 cannons, several machine guns, and trench mortars fell into our hands. Beyond that, the French suffered significant losses in dead and wounded. North of Flirey and near Croix-des-Carmes, the enemy went on the offensive. North of the first mentioned place, they reached our trenches at one point; the battle is still raging over a small section of them. The French have been repelled elsewhere. North of Steinabrück in the Vosges, an attack on our position was repelled.

Eastern front. 

Southwest of Mitau, south of Szadow, and east of Rossienis, the battles continue. Yesterday, strong Russian forces repeatedly attacked our positions north-east and south-east of Kalvaria throughout the day. All attacks failed with very heavy losses for the enemy. Russian advances towards our bridgehead on the Pilicza had the same outcome. That night, the fortress Grodno was bombed.

Southeastern front. 

In West Galicia, the rearguard of the fleeing enemy tried to offer desperate resistance to the allied armies under the command of General von Mackensen yesterday. However, this was broken with heavy blows on the heights of the left bank of the Wisloka, up and downstream from the Ropomouth. By evening, we had not only advanced across the Wisloka in several places, but we had also captured the road of the Dukla Pass and occupied the village of the same name. In the area east of Tarnow and north up to the Weichsel, fighting continued on the right bank of the Dunajec into the night. So far, we have made more than 40,000 prisoners; one should not lose sight of the fact that this happened during frontal battles. In the Beskid Mountains, on the road of the Lupka Pass, the attacks by the troops under Cavalry General von der Marwitz, and of the Austro-Hungarian army, with which they are closely connected, make good progress.

BERLIN, May 7. (Official report from

Western theatre.

Near Ypres, all the English attempts failed to take hill 60, southeast of Zillebeke, from us, which has been a focal point of battle since April 19. We made some progress further towards Ypres. In these battles, the enemy lost 7 machine guns, 1 trench mortar, and several rifles with ammunition yesterday. New attacks caused the English additional serious losses this morning. Between the Meuse and Moselle, we retained and strengthened the captured terrain on the Meuse hills, as well as southwest and south of the Ailly forest. The French remain at Flirey in a small section of trench of our position: all other attacks were repelled there. Enemy attack attempts north of Steinabruck, in the Fecht valley, were smothered by our fire in their infancy.

Eastern theatre.

The battles south of Szadow and east of Roscinie resulted in a sensitive defeat for the Russians, who suffered heavy losses and lost 1,500 prisoners. They are in full retreat. Southwest of Kalvaria, south of Augustowo, and west of Prasznysch, we bloodily repelled isolated Russian attacks. The enemy lost a total of another 520 prisoners.

Southeastern theatre.
The allied troops achieved a significant victory yesterday in battles on the right bank of the lower Dunajec. The enemy is in hasty retreat to the east there; only a small Russian detachment still holds position on the Vistula. We pushed further southward on the right bank of the Wisloka towards the Wislok and over the Jasielika. At various points, detachments of the right flank of the armies under General von Mackensen already encountered Russian columns, retreating hastily on the Carpathian front, pursued closely by the allies. Our spoils continue to grow steadily.

VIENNA, May 6, 4 p.m.

Western theater of war.

Last night, our coastal batteries near Zeebrugge sank an enemy destroyer. Along most of the front, the usual artillery skirmishes took place, which increased in intensity at certain points, such as near Ypres, north of Arras, in the Argonne, and on the Meuse Heights. Only in the Vosges did the infantry engage. The French attacked our positions at Steinabrück on both sides of the Fecht valley after long artillery preparation. All attacks failed and cost the enemy heavy losses.

Eastern theater of war:

Our troops advancing on Libau captured the city. In doing so, they took 1,600 Russians prisoner and seized 12 cannons and four machine guns.

Southeastern theater of war.

Yesterday, Mackensen’s army, along with the Austro-Hungarian troops, continued the pursuit of the defeated enemy with vigor. Only some favorable rear-guard skirmishes took place for us. Last evening, our vanguard had already crossed the Wislok near Krosno. As a result of the coordinated actions of all advancing troop units, quite large Russian forces were cut off. Consequently, the number of Russians captured on the Galician front has increased to approximately 70,000 since May 2. We captured 38 cannons, including 9 heavy pieces.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 8. (Report from the Great Headquarters.) On the Dardanelles front, the enemy retains their old position in the south near Ari Burnu. Yesterday morning, supported by the fleet, they launched an attack in the Sedd el Bahr region. The battle continued until late afternoon and was favorable for us. Our counterattacks drove the heavily losing enemy back to their former landing site. On the left flank, some of our forces pursued the enemy to the Sedd el Bahr landing site, raining bombs on the fleeing enemy. In Azerbaijan, around Dilman, small encounters occurred between our reconnaissance units and Russian militias. On the other fronts, nothing of significance occurred.

LIVERPOOL, May 8. (Reuter report.) On Tuesday, a German submarine torpedoed the steamship 'Candidate'; it sank. All the crew were saved.

VIENNA, 10 May. (Official report from yesterday.) Following the driving out of the enemy from their high positions, our columns crossed the border ridge of the Carpathians. Hungary is cleansed of enemies. The battle continues on Galician territory. The enemy retreats over a front of more than 200 kilometers: from the Vistula to the Uzsok Pass. Victorious, the allied armies advanced fighting over the line Uzsok Pass-Komancza-Krosno-Debica-Seczucin. Near the Uzsok Pass in the Carpathian region and on the front in S.E. Galicia, fairly intense battles also broke out. We captured several Russian positions. On the heights northeast of Ottynia, significant enemy forces attacked our troops. The battle is still ongoing there. Yesterday, our troops stormed the heavily fortified bridgehead Zaleszczyki, which the enemy tried to hold in desperate fights for weeks. We pursued the Russians across the Dniester and captured 3,500 of them.

BERLIN, 10 May. On 7 May, our coastal batteries destroyed the English destroyer "Maori" off the coast of Zeebrugge. The destroyer "Crusader," which tried to approach to provide assistance, was forced to retreat and abandon its launched lifeboats. Our vessels rescued the entire crew of the "Maori," as well as those from the lifeboats of the "Crusader," and brought them, — in total 7 officers and 88 sailors, — to Zeebrugge.

"Lusitania" and hit the ship on the starboard
side, at the height of the command bridge. The
torpedo explosion was immediately followed
by a second, extraordinarily powerful
explosion. The steamship quickly listed to
starboard and began to sink. The
second explosion is attributed to the
detonation of the munitions it had
on board.

Western front.

North of Ypres, west of the canal, we have given up our forward positions at Steenstraat and Het Sas and brought back the weaker forces occupying them to the main positions on the eastern canal bank, in order not to expose them to the heavy enemy artillery fire. The English still hold parts of our front trench that they occupied day before yesterday west of Nieuwkapelle. The fight continues. Near Ablain and Neuville, north of Arras, we repelled French attacks with considerable losses to the enemy. Infantry skirmishes of lesser importance took place at Ailly and in the Priest's Wood. Our airships effectively bombarded the war harbors of Dover and Calais.

DARDANELLES, May 20. Wolff's Telegraph Bureau's special correspondent reports: Since the torpedoing of the “Goliath,” the fleet of the allies has not dared to enter the strait. Regularly, a few ships appear only briefly above the line Sedd-il-Bahr, only to retreat at the first shots from the coastal batteries. The battles on the European front are being continued successfully. The landing troops are being driven back further and further; they have lost several trenches.

ROME, May 20. Salandra presented a bill to the Chamber, which he explained extensively, granting the government extraordinary powers in case of war. The declarations of the prime minister were repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic acclamations and the cry of "long live the war!"

ROME, May 20. With 407 votes against 44 and one abstention, the Chamber passed the bill concerning the government's authority in case of war. The result was greeted with general applause.

LONDON, May 19. (Reuter report.) Rumors are circulating in parliament that a coalition ministry will soon be formed. Three leaders of the Unionist Party had a meeting with Asquith today. It seems that Balfour, Bonar Law, Chamberlain, A.K. Smith, and Lord Derby will take seats in the cabinet. Haldane, Beauchamp, Lucas, and Harcourt would resign. It is also said that the first sea lord Fisher has resigned, and that Churchill will lay down the office of first lord of the admiralty but will continue to be part of the cabinet. Balfour is mentioned as Churchill's successor.

Announcements from the German General Government.

VIENNA, May 22. The government yesterday afternoon handed over to the Italian ambassador, in response to Italy's communication regarding the termination of the Triple Alliance treaty, a reply note, the conclusion of which reads: "The Imperial and Royal Government cannot take notice of the declaration of the Italian Government by which it claims its complete freedom of action and considers its alliance treaty with Austria-Hungary null and void and no longer in effect. This declaration is clearly contrary to the obligations Italy solemnly entered into by the treaty of December 5, 1912. This treaty established the duration of our alliance until July 8, 1920; stipulated that it had to be denounced one year in advance and provided for neither denunciation nor nullification within this timeframe. Since the Italian government is arbitrarily disregarding all these obligations, the Imperial and Royal Government rejects responsibility for the consequences that might result from this."

VIENNA, May 23. (Official report from yesterday). In central Galicia, battles continue. The allied troops have retained the territory regained so far, despite all Russian attacks. Our slow-moving operations advance daily. On the Prut front, it is generally quiet. The enemy's attempt to reach the southern bank at Bojan, east of Czernowitz, failed and cost them heavy losses. In the Kielce highlands, the enemy, after stubborn fighting, is retreating further in a northeasterly direction.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 22. The Great Headquarters reports: Yesterday on the Dardanelles front, only weak infantry and artillery skirmishes took place. Two English armored cruisers shelled our infantry positions on the European and Asian coasts. One of these cruisers was hit twice by our coastal batteries, first fled into the bay of Morte and then left the strait. There is nothing to report from the other battlefields.

LONDON, May 22. (Reuter report.) The sailing ship "Glenholm" from Liverpool was torpedoed yesterday 15 miles southwest of Berehaven. The crew is saved.

Announcements from the German General Government.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 24. Headquarters reports: During the night of May 22 to 23, the enemy attempted to approach our left flank, but he was repulsed with losses. On the morning of May 23, our artillery inflicted heavy damage on an enemy cruiser off Kaba Tepe; moreover, it was hit by two aerial bombs, so that five warships had to tow it. Yesterday, there were no military operations at Ari Burnu and Sedd-el-Bahr. In the battle at Sedd-el-Bahr on May 22, the enemy lost more than 4,000 men, dead and wounded. Yesterday, the enemy fleet shelled our infantry positions on both sides of the strait entrance; their fire was weak and ineffective. One of our batteries destroyed an enemy battery at Sedd-el-Bahr. Nothing of importance on the other battlefields.

CONSTANTINOPLE, May 25. Until now the loss of the Russian armored cruiser of the Black Sea fleet, "Pantileimon", was known only through telegrams from abroad. It is now officially reported here that a Turkish submarine sank the armored cruiser. Turkey kept the presence of a submarine in the Black Sea secret until it was revealed by an act of war.

LONDON, May 25. War correspondent John Buchanan reports from the English headquarters to the "Times": The enemy possesses an astonishingly powerful weapon. As long as we cannot deploy equally formidable weapons, the superior combat value of our soldiers will avail little. This weapon consists of a large number of machine guns and heavy cannons, as well as what appears to be an inexhaustible supply of ammunition with extraordinary explosive power. The inventor of the fable that the Germans are almost out of stock of ammunition has rendered a disservice to the Allies.

LONDON, May 25. The latest casualty list contains the names of 320 officers and 3,450 non-commissioned officers and men, including approximately 500 men from the battleship "Goliath".

LONDON, May 25. Henceforth, butcher shops in Manchester, Liverpool, and in numerous other places will only be open 3 days per week.

approached the enemy to assault distance.
Russian forward movements were generally
bloodily repulsed. Otherwise, the situation is
virtually unchanged.

Ala and Primiero. Otherwise, nothing happened
on the Tyrolean and Carinthian border. In the
coastal area, smaller battles have started. At
Karfreit, an Italian battalion was scattered.
At Plava, a forward movement by an enemy
division, north of Gorizia, was repelled
five times. Last night, some seaplanes
launched another attack on Venice; under
very heavy rifle and gunfire, they dropped

"Notice from the German General Government.

BERLIN, May 31. (Official report from this afternoon.)

Western theater of war.

The French sent considerable forces yesterday to break through our lines north of Arras and in the Priest's Forest. In recent days, the enemy had approached the front Neuville-Roclincourt, near Arras, by means of trenches. We therefore expected an attack on our lines, even more so because all attempts to drive us further northward from our positions had failed. This attack came yesterday afternoon, after an artillery preparation lasting several hours. Brave Rhenish and Bavarian regiments inflicted a complete defeat on the enemy, who suffered exceptionally heavy losses. In the Priest's Forest, the French only succeeded in taking a few of the foremost, weakly occupied trenches. Besides that, the enemy's attack failed in its objectives there as well. Near Ostend, a coastal battery shot down an enemy aircraft. With a few shells, our artillery once again destroyed the railway arch bridge of Dammerkirch; only a few days ago the French, after months of work, had restored it for use.

Eastern theater of war.

- No events of significance.

Southeastern theater of war.

The German troops shifted the front a bit closer to the border and northeast around Przemysl yesterday."

"Announcements from the German General Government.

BERLIN, June 4. (Official report this afternoon.)

Western theater of war. Except for a few houses in the western district, we have stormed and taken the castle and the village of Hooge, east of Ypres. English counterattacks have been bloodily repelled. Last evening, English troops managed to penetrate our position at the north of Givenchy. Through a counterattack, we drove the enemy back out with heavy losses for them. Three English machine guns remained in our hands. We possess the position in its entirety. Our troops captured, after fighting with varied success, the sugar refinery of Souchez. The battle continues along the line west of Souchez. A strong enemy attack collapsed in our artillery fire near and north of Neuville. To the northeast of Neuville, hand-to-hand combat has been ongoing since last night. The battle in the Priest's Wood is over. We have mostly regained the lost trenches.

Eastern theater of war. Our cavalry drove Russian units out of the villages of Lenen and Schrunden, 60 and 70 kilometers east of Libau. Near Rava, to the west of Kurschany, and at Sawdyniki, on the Dubissa, enemy attacks failed.

Southeastern theater of war. After a battle, our troops reached the places east of Przemysl, as well as the line connecting to the northeast at Bolestraszyce-Torki-Pozdziace-Starzawa. The booty taken at Przemysl has not yet been determined. According to statements from prisoners from various troop units, the Russians began a general attack against the entire front of the army under General von Mackensen on the night of June 2 to 3, when Przemysl was stormed. Their offensive has already completely failed at the start. Twenty-two kilometers east of Przemysl, German troops under General von der Marwitz stormed the heights on both sides of Myslatyeze. General von Linsingen's army is on the point of crossing the lower Stryj, northeast of the city of the same name.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 4. The Headquarters reports: On the Dardanelles front, there was a weak artillery and infantry battle yesterday. Our Asian coastal batteries successfully shelled enemy positions at Sedd-il-Bahr. Elsewhere, nothing of importance has occurred.

LONDON, June 4. The 'Evening News' learns from Athens: The Turks have 250,000 men in strongly fortified positions in Gallipoli. The battles consist of attacks and counterattacks. During the day, the allies attack with the help of their fleet; but at night, when the ships cannot participate in the fight to avoid shelling their own troops, the Turks launch extremely fierce counterattacks in closed columns."

Communications from the German General Government.

BERLIN, June 14. (Official report from this afternoon.)

Western theater of war.

We have inflicted a serious defeat on the French on the front between Liévin and Arras. Although our artillery fire repeatedly scattered the enemy attack columns assembled in their storm positions throughout the day, they launched two powerful attacks on our positions on both sides of the Loretto height, as well as on the Neuville-Roclincourt front, in closed ranks towards evening. Everywhere, the enemy was repulsed with heavy losses. All the positions have remained entirely in our possession. Near the Yser Canal, we have repelled relatively weak enemy attacks. Southeast of Hébuterne, the infantry battles did not achieve anything noteworthy. In Champagne, assault movements on the positions we conquered were nipped in the bud.

Eastern theater of war.

We captured some enemy positions near Kuzowinia, northwest of Szawle; 3 officers and 300 men fell into our hands. Southeast of the road from Mariampol to Kowno, our troops stormed the forefront of the Russian lines and captured 2 officers and 313 soldiers.

Southeastern theater of war.

The army of General von Mackensen has left its positions at Czerniawa (northwest of Mosziska) and at Sieniawa and has gone on the offensive over a 70-kilometer front there.

BERLIN, June 15. (Official report of 
this afternoon.)

— Western front.

Yesterday the French suffered another 
defeat. Despite the considerable losses on 
June 13, they continued their breakthrough 
attempt on the Liévin-Arras line with great 
tenacity. Once again, the fire of our brave 
troops stopped the French attacks, which 
were preceded by an extraordinarily fierce 
bombardment, carried out in closed ranks; 
the losses of the enemy are enormous. We 
have not yet managed to retake the trench 
sections that we lost on June 6 northwest of 
Moulin-sous-Touvent (northwest of Soissons). 
North of Perthes and Le Mesnil, in 
Champagne, the battle has flared up again 
here and there; however, the enemy has 
not gained the slightest advantage. 
On Sunday, enemy artillery fired on the 
church of Leflingen, southwest of Ostend, 
during the religious service. Some Belgian 
civilians were injured. Yesterday, an 
enemy squadron dropped bombs on the 
open city of Karlsruhe, which lies entirely 
outside the theater of war and possesses 
no fortifications whatsoever. As far as we 
know so far, 11 civilians were killed and 
6 injured. Of course, there can be no 
question of military damage. One of our 
combat aircraft shot down a plane from 
the enemy squadron. The occupants were 
killed. Another enemy aviator had to 
land near Schirmeck.

Eastern front

West of Szawle, German troops stormed 
and captured the village of Dauksze; they 
then repelled several counterattacks by 2 
to 3 Russian regiments. 4 officers and 1,660 
men were taken prisoner. A significant 
enemy force repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, 
attacked our newly won positions south and 
east of the Mariampol-Kowno road 
yesterday. Our troops went on the attack on 
the Lipowo-Kalwaria front, broke through the 
Russian positions, and captured the foremost 
Russian trenches. On the Orzyc, our troops 
stormed the village of Jednorozec, southeast of 
Chorzele, as well as Czerwona-Gora and 
the bridge to the east of it. The booty at this 
place amounts to 425 prisoners. Enemy 
attack attempts at points of our intrusion 
in their positions near Bolimow failed.

Southeastern front.

The enemy, defeated in the battle on 
June 13 and 14 by General von Mackensen's 
army, has not succeeded in establishing 
itself in its prepared second position 
northwest of Jaworowo. The enemy was

The booty is growing. In view of the 
vigorous pursuit, the Russians must also 
retreat south of the Przemysl-Lemberg

"Announcements from the German General Staff:

VIENNA, June 16. (Official report of yesterday.)
Russian battlefield.

The offensive operations of the allied armies resulted in heavy fighting along almost the entire Galician front. The troops of Archduke Josef-Ferdinand’s army, after the capture of Sieniawa, began their advance on the eastern bank of the San River towards the north and northeast. Yesterday, the castle and the farm of Piskorowice were stormed, with numerous prisoners falling into our hands. General von Mackensen's army advances amid fierce battles on both sides of Krakowice and towards Oleszyce. The troops under General Boehm-Ermolli, joining the attack, strike the Russians east and southeast of Mosziska, where the enemy in new positions blocks the road to Grodek. South of the upper Dniester, significant Russian forces defend the bridgeheads of Mikolajow, Zydaczow, and Halicz against the allied troops of the army under von Linsingen, while General Pflanzer-Baltin's troops, downstream, stand before Nizniow and Czernelica and hold Zaleszczyki against all Russian attacks. Parts of this army forced the Russians in Bessarabia, between the Dniester and Prut, to retreat once more to Chotin and along the Prut. The number of Russian prisoners from the battles in Galicia since June 12 has increased by a few thousand men yesterday.

Italian battlefield.
The Italians made new, futile attempts to approach our positions near Tolmein and Plava. In some sectors of the Isonzo front, calm prevailed yesterday. The Italians sent a parliamentarian to request a ceasefire to bury the dead, but this request had to be denied for military reasons. Near the Carinthian border, the Styrian militia stormed the Kleine Pal, east of the Ploecken Pass, repelling three counterattacks on this mountain. In the border area of Tyrol, the enemy reconnoiters our positions and continues its futile shelling. At a border point, a watchpost of the imperial guard, without losing a single man, forced an enemy company to retreat and captured 58 Italians.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 14. The Headquarters announces: On the Caucasian front, the enemy attacked yesterday from the direction of Olty. As soon as he was convinced that our troops were meeting him, he hastily retreated and abandoned his positions entirely. We captured them. On the Dardanelles front, two enemy warships, protected by seven torpedo boats, fired a total of 90 shells at some of our positions near Ari Burnu and Sedd-el-Bahr. The effect was nil. The ships soon steamed back to Imbros. On land, only a few cannon and gunshots were exchanged. Our Anatolian batteries fired on the enemy with good effect."

"Announcements from the German General Government. BERLIN, June 16. Official report this afternoon. Western front. As a result of the recent Russian defeats, the French and English attacked yesterday at many points on the western front with significant forces. The English succeeded in pushing back our position north of the Bellewaarde Pond, near Hooge, a little. The battle continues there. Two attacks by four English divisions between the street Estaires-La Bassée and the La Bassée canal failed completely. Our brave Westphalian regiments and parts of the guard brought there repelled the attack after bitter life-or-death fighting. This cost the enemy heavy losses. They left a number of machine guns and a mine thrower in our hands. After their defeats on June 13 and 14 at the Lorette Height, the enemy left our position, which the Badeners defended there with extraordinary stubbornness, untouched this time. At Moulin-sous-Touvent the battle continues. An enemy attempt to break through our lines in the Vosges between the valley of the Fecht and the Lauch failed. Only northwest of Metzeral and at the Hilsenfirst is fighting still taking place. Elsewhere all attacks have already been repelled. Eastern front. In the Davina sector (southeast of Mariampol), east of Augustowo, and north of Bolimow, Russian attacks have been repelled. On the Lipowo-Kalwaria front, we gained some ground again. We have taken some places there. 2,040 prisoners and 3 machine guns fell into our hands. Southeastern front. North of the upper Vistula, the troops under General von Woyrsch repelled the Russian attacks on the positions we took from the enemy on June 14. Yesterday the defeated Russian armies tried to stop the pursuit of the allied armies along the whole front between the San, north of Sieniawa and the swamps of the Dniester, east of Sambor. After a hot fight, they were driven out of all their positions by evening at Kieplice (north of Sieniawa) — southwest of the Lubaszów-Zawadówka sector (southwest of Niemirow) — west of Jaworów — west of Ladowa-Wisznia. We continue the pursuit. General von Mackensen's army has captured more than 40,000 Russians and seized 69 machine guns since June 12. The Russians have gained some ground between the swamps of the Dniester and Zurawno. The overall situation in this place is unchanged. CORRECTION: In the report of June 13, a printing error slipped into the 'Eastern front'. The incursion into the Russian position did not take place south, but indeed north of Bolimow, as could be seen from the report of June 12."

Announcements from the German General Government.

VIENNA, June 17. (Official report from yesterday.)

Russian battlefield.

The Russians could not stop the general attack of the allied armies in Galicia, despite their most stubborn resistance. The remnants of the defeated Russian army corps retreat, pursued by our victorious troops, over Cewkow, Lubaczow, and Jaworow. South of the Lemberg line, the army of Boehm-Ermolli stormed the Russian positions across the entire front last night and drove the enemy back over Sadowa-Wisznia and Rudki. To the south of the Dniester, fighting is taking place in the areas in front of the bridgeheads. The troops of the army under Pflanzer occupied Nizniow yesterday morning. The battles and fights fought so far in the month of June yielded rich spoils. From June 1st to the 15th, these amounted to a total of: 108 officers, 122,300 lower ranks as prisoners, 53 cannons, 187 machine guns, and 58 ammunition wagons.

Italian battlefield.

The Italians again attempted attacks here and there. However, they were driven back everywhere; this was the case at the Isonzo near Monfalcone, Sagrado, and Plava, in the area east of Plocken (on the border of Carinthia), and near Peutelstein in the Tyrolean border strip.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 15. The headquarters reports: On the Dardanelles front, our artillery positioned opposite Ari Burnu, on the morning of June 13, destroyed the positions the enemy had just built for his mortars and machine gun emplacements. Our well-directed artillery fire caused a fire behind the enemy trenches that lasted half an hour. During the night of June 13 to 14, one of our small reconnaissance patrols penetrated the enemy trenches at Sedd-ul-Bahr, where it captured a machine gun with all its accessories, 15 rifles with bayonets, and a large quantity of cartridges. Yesterday, one of our aviators flew over the islands of Imbros and Lemnos and dropped bombs on an enemy camp on Lemnos. Our coastal batteries yesterday shelled the artillery positions at Sedd-ul-Bahr and the anchorage of the enemy's transport ships. In the course of the same day, an aviator took off over our batteries, to whose well-directed fire he is almost daily exposed; he dropped 7 bombs without causing the slightest damage. From the other battlefields, there is nothing to report.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 17. According to reliable reports, on June 9, a large enemy warship sunk between the island of Kalymnos and the Asian coast as a result of an explosion. The reports have not yet been officially confirmed.

"Notices from the German General Staff.

BERLIN, June 17.

— Western battlefield.

North of the pond of Bellegarde, we have, for the most part, recaptured the trench sections lost yesterday. The English and French continued their attempts to break through our front.

— North of the La Bassée canal, Westphalians and Saxons overran English troops in hand-to-hand combat and forced them into a rapid retreat to their positions. The French still launched new attacks on the front from west of Liévin to Arras. At the Lorette Heights, we gave up to them a trench totally destroyed by shells. South of Souchez, they succeeded in gaining a footing on a 600-meter front in our position. The battle continues in this place. Everywhere else they were bloodily repulsed. The large amount of ammunition they expended, and their disregard for the enormous losses that their attacks incurred, could not prevent the French and English from suffering another defeat. The life-or-death battles, which ended with our victory, again bear witness to the brilliant bravery and unwavering endurance of our troops. French attacks at Moulin-sous-Touvent also ended unfavorably for the enemy, who lost 5 officers and 300 soldiers as prisoners. In the Vosges, the fierce battles in the Fecht and Lauch valleys also continued yesterday but ended in the evening. Apart from a small loss of ground northwest of Metzeral, all our positions remain in our possession. 100 Evouzvél fell into our hands.

— Eastern battlefield.

Various Russian attacks were repelled. Otherwise, nothing significant to report.

Southeastern battlefield.

The attacks of the allied troops drove the Russians from their positions north of Sieniawa and forced them to retreat to Tarnograd. General von Mackensen’s army is in close pursuit of the enemy. Dachnów and Lubaczów were taken by storm. The southern Smolnik coast was cleared of the enemy. At Niemirów, Russian resistance was soon broken; we crossed the Niemirów-Jaworów road. Further south, the Russians are retreating on the Wereszyca. Southeast of the Dniester marshes, the situation remains unchanged.

— CONSTANTINOPLE, June 16. Headquarters reports: At Ari Burnu, on the Dardanelles front, our artillery opened well-aimed fire. We could observe that our fire caused considerable losses to the enemy at one of their artillery positions. Our coastal batteries effectively fired on enemy transport ships, camp sites, and aircraft hangars near the coast."

VIENNA, June 18. (Official report of yesterday.)
Russian battlefield.

Even yesterday, the defeated Russian armies could not hold their ground anywhere. In central Galicia, they continued to retreat along the entire front in a northeasterly and easterly direction, leaving strong rearguards to cover their retreat. The allied armies pursued them closely. North of Sieniawa, our troops advanced over Cieplice and Cewkow; yesterday, they drove a significant Russian force, still on Galician soil, back over the state borders, inflicting heavy losses. The allied troops farther east occupied Lubaczów, expelled the Russians from Niemirow after a fierce battle, and advanced towards Janow. On the Lemberg line, troops under Boehm defeated strong Russian rearguards near Wolczuchy late in the evening, driving them back over the Wereszyca, and at midnight stormed the western front of Grodek. South of Grodek, the western bank of the Wereszyca was also cleared of the enemy. The general situation south of the Dniester remains unchanged. Italian battlefield.

On the Isonzo front, our troops repelled several attacks at Plava once again, causing great losses to the enemy. In the rocky area of Krn, the mountain troops continued the fighting. Nothing noteworthy happened on the Carinthian border yesterday. In Tyrol, enemy offensive movements were halted at the Tillia-Cher-Joch, near Tre Sassi, Buchenstein in the Tofane area, and on Mount Coste, east of Folgaria.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 16. One of our flyers saw a battleship resembling the "Agamemnon" in the Kefale Bay, near Imbros. The deck was almost underwater; the rear smokestack and the rear mast had completely disappeared into the water. Nothing significant happened on the other fronts.

BERLIN, June 17. (Official.) On the night of June 15-16, our fleet airships conducted an attack on the Northeast coast of England. They bombarded a coastal fort with bombs, setting numerous industrial facilities on fire, including a blast furnace, which were partially destroyed. The airships were intensely fired upon, especially by a coastal battery, which was attacked and silenced. The airships were unharmed.

BERLIN, June 18. The claim in the French official report of June 16, 11 PM, that the Reims Cathedral was shelled with incendiary shells, is false. The shelling was largely aimed at the Qost barracks, as well as the batteries near the railway junction north of Reims, which were taking aim at our positions.

"Notification from the German General Government.

BERLIN, June 18. (Official announcement from this afternoon.)

Western theater of war.

The enemies continue their vain attempts to break through our front north of Arras. The English suffered a new defeat north of the La Bassée canal; their assault troops were mowed down, only a few soldiers could escape by fleeing. The French have penetrated our frontline at a few points east of Angres, south of Souchez, and north of Ecurie. Just north of the Loretto heights, we voluntarily evacuated a section of trench that came under the enfilading fire of the enemy artillery. All other attackers have been repelled. In the combat area north of Arras, since June 16, we have captured 17 officers and 647 men. The bloody losses of the French are comparable to those of the battle in Champagne. In the Argonne forest, we repulsed weak forward movements of the enemy. Near Vauquois, local fighting occurred. In the Vosges, the battles west of Metzeral are still ongoing.

Eastern theater of war.

German cavalry drove advancing Russian detachments back across the Szymsza sector east of the Cytowiany-Szawle road. A strong Russian attack on the Dwina failed.

Southeastern region.

On both sides of Tarnogrod, the allied troops pushed the enemy back to the drainage basin of the Tanew at night. The army under General von Mackensen drove the defeated Russians back into the positions prepared near Grodek (line Narol-Miasto-Nagierow-brook Wereszyca to its mouth in the Dniester). On the Dniester front, the situation northeast of Stryj remains unchanged.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 17. The headquarters reports: On the Dardanelles front, the artillery fire of our left wing destroyed an enemy aircraft on the morning of June 15, while it was flying over our positions near Ari Burnu; it fell behind the enemy trenches. Yesterday, nothing significant happened near Ari Burnu and Sedd-ul-Bahr. Our coastal batteries in the straits took the enemy's artillery positions, troops, and a transport column under fire near Sedd-ul-Bahr. They blew up a munitions wagon of said column. On the other fronts, no noteworthy military operations took place.

LONDON, June 17. The latest casualty list contains the names of 38 officers and 3,420 men.

VIENNA, 19 June. (Official report from yesterday.)

Russian Theater of Operations.

North of Sieniawa, the pursuit advanced our troops into Russian territory, where they reached the heights north of Kreszow, as well as the lowlands of the Tanew and occupied Tarnograd. The Russian force stationed between the lower San and the Vistula is also retreating at various points. Cieszanow and the heights north of this place were captured. Significant Russian forces have occupied new positions in the mountainous region east of Niemirow, as well as in the vicinity of Janow. Fighting is taking place on the Wereszyca. Our troops have gained a foothold at some points southeast of this river. South of the upper Dniester, the Russians had to abandon their positions near Litynia after fierce fighting and retreat to Kolodruby. In the pursuit, our troops reached the mouth of the Wereszyca. Otherwise, the situation at the Dniester remains unchanged. The eastern wing of General Pflanzer's army repelled eight Russian assaults between the Prut and Dniester yesterday with heavy Russian losses. The enemy, who used all possible forces to push our troops back in Bukovina, suffered heavy losses under our artillery fire and fled. 8 officers and 1,002 soldiers were captured, and 3 machine guns were seized.

Italian Theater of Operations.

The latest offensive movements on the Isonzo brought the Italians as little advantage as before. Our brave Dalmatian troops repelled an Italian brigade at Plava the night before last. Again yesterday, the enemy attacked without more success. On the battlefield, two Piedmontese brigades and a militia regiment were observed in wartime condition. The Italians suffered severe losses here, as well as in the Krn region. New enemy attacks in the Plocken area and on Monte Coste were also repelled.

LONDON, 17 June. (Reuter report.) The English steamship "Trafford," traveling from Cork to Sydney, was sunk by a German submarine in the Irish Sea yesterday. The crew is safe.

German communication, Berlin, 19 June. (Official report of the General Staff) Western battlefield. The latest attacks by the French north of Arras were as unsuccessful as the previous ones. North of the La Bassée canal, a British forward movement was stopped with ease. Near the Loretto height, on both sides of Neuville and northeast of Arras, several French attacks collapsed. We have cleared some trenches of the enemy that were previously lost. In the Argonne forest, we repelled local attacks with the bayonet. At Vauquois, the battles remained undecided. Northeast of Luneville, we took the village of Embermenil, which the French had reinforced and occupied. After destroying all the French defensive works, our troops withdrew to their old positions and brought back approximately 50 French chasseurs as prisoners. In the Vosges, the fight continues at several points in the Fechtdal. At the Hilsenfirst, we captured more than 200 Frenchmen. — Eastern battlefield. In the vicinity of Szawle-Dawina and the Szlawanta sector, Russian attack movements were stopped. We made some progress southwest of Kalwaria. The village of Vac was taken. Southeastern battlefield. The Russians west of the San were driven back to the line of Zapuscie-Ulanow and further to the east over the Tanew-Pauczka line. The attack on the position at Grodek has begun. The Russians, who are still between the Dniester marshes and the Stryj, were attacked and pushed northwards. The attacks continue. Constantinople, 19 June. The General Staff reports: On the Dardanelles front, our artillery fire destroyed the enemy's machine gun positions and important observation points at Ari Burnu on 16 June. An enemy artillery piece was put out of action. One of our regiments on the right wing captured and occupied part of the enemy's trenches. Yesterday, at Ari Burnu and Sedd-ul-Bahr, weak artillery and rifle fire was exchanged, which, however, did not bring about any significant change. Since 14 June, the enemy has used shells that release suffocating gases. Nothing new on the other fronts. The General Government in Belgium

VIENNA, June 20. (Official report from yesterday.)

Russian theater of war.

The battle continues in Galicia. Austro-Hungarian and German troops stormed one position after another of the mutually connected Russian defensive works, both on and north of the Wereszyca. Grodek and Komarno are in our hands. On the northern front, the southern bank of the Tanew river was cleared of the enemy. After fierce fighting, Ulanow could be occupied. South of the upper Dniester, the attack of the allies is making good progress. The eastern wing of the army under Pflanzer repelled new Russian attacks bloodily.

Italian theater of war.

After the latest fruitless and costly forward movements of the Italians, calm prevails on the Isonzo front and near the Carinthian border, disturbed only by skirmishes and local artillery fire. Yesterday afternoon, our artillery at Plava already smothered a new attack in its bud. In the Tyrolean border area, the Italian detachments trying to attack the mountain passes east of the Fassadal were repelled everywhere. The enemy ceased his futile attacks on the Folgaria-Lavarone plateau. In the few "liberated" villages of the border area, the Italians oppress the population by appointing hostages and employing brutal coercive measures.

VIENNA, June 19. The day before yesterday and yesterday some of our cruisers and torpedo boats undertook a cruise near the Italian coast, from the imperial border to near Fano. They damaged the signaling installations at the mouth of the Tagliamento and near Pesaro, as well as the railway bridges over the Metauro and the Arcilla near Rimini. An Italian armored ship was sunk; the crew was rescued. All our warships have returned undamaged.

LONDON, June 19. The naval correspondent of the "Times" writes: The fact that German submarines have sunk no fewer than 73 ships since the beginning of the month of June throws a peculiar light on Churchill's declaration at Dundee that the submarine danger is now limited within fixed boundaries.

LONDON, June 19. — The steamship "Dulcie" (2,000 tons) was torpedoed by a German submarine near the coast of Suffolk without warning. The crew is saved except for one man.

LONDON, June 20. — The steamship "Ailisa" from Leith was torpedoed."

BERLIN, June 21. (Official report from yesterday.)

Western battlefield.

North of the La Bassée Canal, as well as on the front north of Arras, we have repelled several separate enemy attacks with heavy losses. A French unit, which attacked near Perthes in Champagne following a mine explosion, was cut to pieces. French enterprises against our outposts near the Parroy forest led to local fights, in which we gained the upper hand. The French have opened a heavy fire on Munster in the Vosges; their repeated attacks in the Fecht Valley, as well as south of it, brought them no advantage. An enemy aircraft squadron bombarded Iseghem in Flanders without causing military damage; one aircraft was shot down, several others were forced to hastily return. We also shot down an enemy aircraft over Vouziers in Champagne.

Eastern battlefield.

Near Szawle and Augustowo, Russian attacks were repelled. Forward movements of relatively small German units put us in possession of the forward enemy positions at Budt-Przysieki and at Zalesie (east of the Prasnysz-Myszyniec road).

Southeastern battlefield.

Troops under General von Woyrsch captured several forward works of the enemy south of the Pilica in recent days. The armies of General von Mackensen have captured the position at Grodek. Yesterday, in the early morning hours, German troops and the corps of General von Arz launched an attack on the well-entrenched enemy position. After a stubborn struggle, the various successive rows of trenches over a 35-kilometer front, extending from north of Janow to Huta-Obeddynska (southwest of Rawa-Ruska), were almost entirely captured by storm in the afternoon. By evening, the enemy was driven back behind the main road from Lolkiew (north of Lemberg) to Rawa-Ruska. As a result of this defeat, the enemy also began retreating last night from the adjacent position between Grodek and the Dniester marshes. The Austro-Hungarian troops are closely pursuing them there. Between the Dniester marshes and the Stryj estuary, the enemy has evacuated the southern Dniester bank.

VIENNA, June 20. (Official report from 10 a.m.) Repulsed entirely on the Wereszyca position front, the Russians have been in full retreat since 3 a.m.

"Communications from the German General-Government.

BERLIN, June 21. (Official report from this afternoon.)

Western front.

On the front north of Arras, the enemy mainly used artillery. Only north of Souchez, an infantry attack followed, which we repelled. The French's nocturnal forward movement towards our position west of Moulin-sous-Touvent, southwest of Soissons, failed. On the western edge of the Argonne, we went on the offensive. Wurttemberg and north German militias stormed, over a front width of 2 kilometers, various consecutive defensive lines and inflicted enormous losses on the French in their futile counter-attack. In this action, we captured 6 officers with 623 men and took 3 machine guns and 3 trench mortars. On the Meuse Heights:

In the evening, the French made 5 vigorous attacks on our positions at Grande Tranchée, west of Les Éparges; all were halted west of the road by our fire. East of the road, the enemy reached points in our position; however, he has already partially been expelled and left 70 prisoners in our hands. Northwest of Lunéville, we had to withdraw our outposts, who held out near Condrexon, for a superior enemy to the main position, northeast of this place. In the Vosges, enemy attacks in the Fecht Valley and south of it were repulsed bloodily. During the night, we voluntarily evacuated Metzeral, which was destroyed by French artillery, to save futile losses.

Eastern front.

In the region northwest of Šiauliai and west of the upper Dubissa, some Russian attacks failed, some of which were undertaken with considerable forces.

Southeastern front.

The armies of General von Mackensen continue their offensive movement towards Lemberg and Lolkiew. Rawa Ruska is in our possession. German troops attacked and defeated the enemy west of Rawa Ruska yesterday. On June 19 and 20, nearly 9,500 Russians were captured on the battlefield between Janów and north of Magierów, and 8 guns and 26 machine guns captured.

VIENNA, June 21. (Official report from yesterday.)

Italian front.

Also yesterday, the Isonzo front was quiet again after we easily repelled very weak Italian attacks at Plava, Ronchi, and Monfalcone. Here and near the border, enemy artillery fires without effect on our fortifications. The attacks, which the enemy undertook with at least a brigade on our positions east of the Fassa Valley and which, as already mentioned, were repelled everywhere, cost him heavy losses. In front of one single support point of ours, 175 bodies lay."

"Announcements of the German General Government.

VIENNA, June 22. (Official report from yesterday.)

- Russian front.

The allied troops are at the gates of Zolkiew, near Lemberg, and at the river Szczerzek south of this city. They have attacked the Russians everywhere on this front. The enemy still controls the crossings of the Dniester at Mikolajow and Zydaczow. Troops of the army under Pflanzer have repelled vigorous Russian attacks southwest of Potok and Zloty, near Zaleszczyki, and in the Bessarabian border region, causing immense losses to the enemy. Otherwise, the situation in the northeast is unchanged.

Italian front.

Our brave troops repelled two more Italian attacks during the night of June 20 at Plava. An Italian officer with a white flag, accompanied by a horn blower, appeared before our position to present a request on behalf of his brigade commander. Since these individuals could not prove their capacity as negotiators with a written mandate, they were taken prisoner. In the area northwest of the Krn, the enemy was driven out of his rear position; detachments of the Debrecen Honvéd infantry regiment distinguished themselves notably on this occasion. Our heavy artillery successfully engaged in the mountain battles. Southeast of Plecken, near the Carinthian border, the enemy once again attacked in vain. Nothing significant has happened in the Tyrolean border area. The Italian heavy artillery can do nothing against our forts. On June 19, a torpedo boat successfully shelled the tanks and port installations at Monopoli; on the same day, our seaplanes bombed and damaged stations at Bari and Brindisi.

Southeastern front.

No changes have occurred here recently.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 20. The Headquarters reports: On the Caucasus front, our troops repelled attacks by which the enemy covered his initial retreat. During our counterattacks, we took prisoners and captured 3 machine guns. In the area of Olty, our troops are making progress despite the fierce resistance of the Russians. In these battles, the enemy left 200 corpses on the battlefield, including some officers; prisoners, rifles, tents, and equipment also fell into our hands. On the Dardanelles front, on June 17, our batteries fired on enemy positions for wireless telegraphy and heliostats at Ari Burnu. Most of the enemy soldiers working there were killed. One of our shells inflicted heavy damage on an enemy torpedo boat. On June 18, our artillery successfully bombarded the enemy's left wing, which suffered considerable losses. To escape the deadly fire of our coastal batteries, the enemy took another position. But even here, German batteries soon hurled their shells. The enemy artillery that targeted our infantry was silenced. On the other fronts, the situation is unchanged.

BERLIN, June 21. (Official.) On June 20, one of our submarines attacked a British armored cruiser approximately 100 nautical miles east of the Firth of Forth, which apparently belonged to the Minotaur class. The torpedo hit its target. However, the submarine could not verify the outcome.

COLOGNE, June 21. The "Cologne People's Newspaper" reports: The German cardinals von Bettinger (Munich) and von Hartmann (Cologne) have sent the following telegram to the Emperor: "Outraged by the slander cast by the book 'The German War and Catholicism' on the German fatherland and its glorious army, we cannot refrain from expressing to Your Majesty in the name of the entire German episcopate our deep disappointment about it. We shall consider it our duty to complain to the Head of the Church." The Archbishop of Cologne received the following reply: "I thank you and Cardinal Bettinger warmly for the expression of the German episcopate's disappointment regarding the disgraceful literary slander on the German people and army by our enemies. Even such attacks are repulsed by the pure conscience and moral strength with which the German people defend their just cause; they ultimately rebound upon their instigators themselves."

STOCKHOLM, June 20. The "Aftonbladet" sharply expresses the indignation of the Swedish people over the dropping of bombs by aircraft on the castle in Karlsruhe, where the Queen of Sweden was staying. It was a deliberate attack on a royal residence inhabited only by women and children, says the paper. The audacity that led the French military command to spare not even the childhood home of the Swedish Queen gives substance for reflection in Sweden. Such a deed, the paper further says, is neither chivalrous nor in keeping with the view that Sweden had of the French character. The "Daily General" reports that the people have decided to honor the Queen, as a sign of joy and gratitude for her escape from this danger, in a particularly splendid manner upon her return to Sweden.

Western theatre of war.

On the western canal bank, we repelled attacks on farms we occupied northwest of Dixmude. North of Arras, artillery battles were intense yesterday. Around midnight, we repelled a French assault in the maze south of Neuville. After successful mine explosions west of Perthes in Champagne, we advanced our position slightly. On the Meuse hills, hand-to-hand fights lasted all day under intense cannon fire. Around three o'clock this morning, we counterattacked, nearly completely clearing our trenches of the enemy, taking 130 prisoners. A weak attack attempt at Marcheville was thwarted. In the area east of Lunéville, outpost skirmishes at Lemetrey developed again. In the Vosges, we voluntarily withdrew to east of Sondernach, on the eastern bank of the Fecht, without being harassed by the enemy. New attacks near the Hilsenfirst heights inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. Our aircraft dropped bombs on the airfield near Courcelles, west of Reims. Enemy aircraft bombs did no military damage in either Bruges or Ostend.

Yesterday we shelled the fortress of Dunkirk, as well as the enemy troop concentrations at the towns of St.-Winoksbergen, Hondschoote, Fournes, and Kassel. From Givenchy to north of the La Bassée canal and at Neuville, our artillery suppressed enemy attacks in the bud. Our trench warfare is making good progress south of Souchez. On the Meuse Heights, the French continue their breakthrough attempts without achieving even the slightest advantage; moreover, their fruitless attacks cost them serious losses. So far, we have taken 280 unharmed Frenchmen, including 8 officers, as prisoners and captured 80 machine guns along with 20 mortars. East of Lunéville, the outpost engagements are still ongoing. In the Vosges, we stormed the height 631 near Ban de Sapt, which dominates the area and has been fiercely contested for months. Here we captured 193 prisoners, 3 machine guns, 1 mortar, and much other equipment. The enemy vainly attempted to retake this position. South of Neuville, one of our aviators shot down an enemy aircraft. What the French official report states about the capture of a German trench southwest of St-Joris by the Belgians is completely fabricated.

Eastern front

Nothing new.

Southeastern front

Austrian troops stormed and captured Lemberg yesterday afternoon, as well as the connecting Szczerek position from near Mikolajow, on the Dniester, to Lemberg. Further north, pursuing troops occupied the line Zoltance-Turynka (northeast of Zolkiew) east of Lemberg. Near Ravaruska and to the west of it, the situation remains unchanged. The Russians are retreating in the San and Vistula regions, as well as to the left of the Vistula.

VIENNA, June 23. — Report from yesterday.)

Notices from the German General Government.

LONDON, June 23. American papers reprint the following article from the Japanese newspaper "Tschugai Schogja Schimpo" of Tokyo:

"It would be insane to even consider sending troops to Europe. England will not treat us with friendship for long. Once England has achieved its goals, it will deny all its former helpers. We are equals to England. Now we must regret that we were compelled to help England due to a treaty. There is no longer any doubt that an understanding with Germany would have been much better for Japan’s future. The near future will bring serious complications. We will have to prove that we are a cultural state of the first rank and that we are on the same level of civilization as England and America. It is no secret that we do not need to fear these two powers, for our strength allows us to hold a colony on America's West Coast, which we have long desired. We must stockpile enormous quantities of artillery and munitions. America is now supplying weapons and ammunition to Germany's enemies; perhaps the day will come when Germany will, rightfully, supply us with weapons and ammunition against the United States of North America and against Australia. The German prisoners of war cannot deny that we have treated them chivalrously. Russia, France, and especially England do not treat German prisoners as befits men and heroes. No German who has fallen into Japanese captivity will have any complaint about their treatment by us. We have granted all their wishes and treated German women and children with respect and esteem. The blow we had to deal to Germany will be forgotten, and it can be repaired to Germany's satisfaction in some way. However, we cannot say anything more about that now. It also depends on the strength of German arms. There is no longer any doubt that Germany and Austria will triumph, even if new enemies emerge. On the day of reckoning, we will also be there and show the world that we have the right to call our country a cultural state, from which Germany's current enemies will learn what is meant by chivalry and justice. We have absolutely no reason to hate Germany. We hold its integrity in very high regard."

Official report from yesterday.

Russian theater of war.

The Russians had entrusted the defense of the sectors Zolkiew-Mikolajow on the northwest and west front of the belt surrounding Lemberg to a considerable force. On June 22 at 5 AM, the Viennese militia stormed the field fortification Rzezna on the road Janow-Lemberg. At the same time, our troops advanced over the heights east of the Mlynowka stream and stormed some fieldworks in front of the height Lysa-Gora. The other redoubts and defensive works on the northwest and west fronts were conquered during the morning after bloody battles. As a result, the Russian front was once again broken through. The enemy had to accept retreat again with heavy losses. Our troops pursued the enemy to beyond the heights east and northeast of Lemberg and crossed south of this city the road leading to Mikolajow. Cavalry General Boehm-Ermolli, at the head of the army group, made his entrance into Lemberg at 4 PM, amid the cheering of the population. Also, at Zolkiew and east of Rawaruska the Russians are retreating. Local forward movements of the enemy at the Tanew were halted. Last night, the enemy began retreating further between the San and the Vistula and in the mountainous area near Kielce. The allied troops are pursuing him at all points. The general situation at the Dniester remains unchanged.

Italian theater of war.

The Italians, who have now been at war for a full month, can point to no serious advantage. Our troops are holding their positions in the southwest in the same locations near or at the border as before the outbreak of hostilities. On the Isonzo front, in the fortified border area Flitsch-Malborghet, at the Krn ridge and on all other fronts in Tyrol, the enemy advance was halted with heavy losses for the Italians.

LONDON, June 23. Reuter learns from Norwich that the steamship "Punisiana" was stranded near Pokefields shortly before 2 PM. The ship had been torpedoed by a German submarine. The 33 crew members have landed at Lowestoft. The "Punisiana" was on its way from Montreal to Hull with a load of wheat.

LONDON, June 23. (Reuter report.) Lloyd learns from Fraserburgh (county of Aberdeen): The English steamship "Carisbrook", which was on its way with a load of wheat from Montreal to Leith, was sunk by a German submarine off Kinnairds Head. The crew has arrived in Fraserburgh.

BERLIN, 24 June. (Official report from this afternoon.)

Western front.

On the eastern slope of the Loretto Heights, we drove the enemy out of a trench section that he had captured a few days ago. South of Souchez, the battles are turning in our favor. We repelled a powerful night attack on our Labyrinth position, south of Neuville, which turned into a fierce hand-to-hand battle, and we maintained our position. On the Meuse Heights, there were again bloody clashes, in which we took 150 French prisoners. Two failed attacks cost the enemy significant losses. We thwarted an attempt on the heights near Bar-de-Sapt, which we have held since yesterday. 50 remained in our hands.

Eastern front.

In a repelled attack to the N.-E. of Kurschany, the Russians lost about 100 men as prisoners. At the Omule, a forward movement led to us capturing the village of Kopaczyska. In Poland, several enemy attacks south of the Vistula were halted.

Southeastern front.

The army of General von Linsingen has crossed the Dniester. It is engaged in heavy fighting on the northern bank between Halicz, still occupied by the enemy, and Zurawno. North of there, to the area east of Lviv and Zolkiew, the Russians are being further pursued. Between Rawaruska and the San, near Ulanow, nothing of importance happened. From the corner formed by the San and the Vistula, the Russians have retreated behind the San. On the left bank of the Vistula, south of Ilza, they are also moving to the north.

VI Announcements of the Government.

VIENNA, 25 June. (Official report of yesterday.)

Russian battlefield.

In Eastern Galicia, the general situation has not changed. East and northeast of Lemberg, strong Russian rear guards are being fought. At the Dniester, Mikolajow and Zydaczow were captured. Downstream from this last city, the allied troops, in stubborn battles, have reached the northern bank of the Dniester at several locations. The enemy is retreating further between the Vistula and San. North of the Vistula, Russian rear guards were pushed back to beyond Amienna. Our troops have occupied Ores and Sandomierz.

Italian battlefield.

Our troops repelled an attack by a significant Italian force near the Klemen Pass, on the Carinthian border. Otherwise, military operations here and on the Tyrolean border were limited to artillery skirmishes. Calm prevails in the Krn area. At the Isonzo, a fierce artillery battle is raging. At Gradisca and Monfalcone, the Italians stormed in vain.

CONSTANTINOPLE, 23 June. The General Headquarters reports: Our troops, operating in the direction of Olty, launched numerous attacks and pushed the strong Russian right wing located there further east. As a result, important enemy positions and rich booty fell into our hands. Recently captured Russians stated that in Russia, men aged 50 are already being called to arms and equipped with Berdan rifles, and that the new recruits, as well as the population of more than one area, have opposed the war. On the Dardanelles front, the enemy repeatedly attacked our southern position near Sedd-el-Bahr on the morning of 21 June. He was aided by his heavy-caliber artillery and the recently arrived reinforcements; these attacks, which continued until midnight, completely failed nevertheless. The enemy was driven back to his old positions with enormous losses. On 20 June, a section of our batteries north of Ari Burnu damaged two large enemy transport ships patrolling in this area; as a result, they were forced to withdraw. On the morning of 21 June, our artillery fire destroyed a gun emplacement the enemy was fortifying. From the other fronts, there is nothing special to report.

BERLIN, 24 June. On 22 May, a German aircraft in the Baltic Sea, 25 nautical miles east of Gotland, bombed a Russian submarine, presumably of the Akula-type. At the time, it could not be determined if it was hit; but now it is admitted from the Russian side that the submarine is lost.

At Sedd-ul-Bahr, the situation has remained unchanged since the last battle in which the enemy was driven back to his old positions. Since then, he has undertaken no movements of any significance. So far, we have not been able to even approximately determine the extraordinarily large losses of the enemy in the battle of June 21. Our artillery does not fire on the hospital ships that are continuously evacuating the wounded. On the night of June 25, one of our reconnaissance patrols from the right flank surprised an enemy unit in a trench at Sedd-ul-Bahr, destroyed it, destroyed the machine guns, and returned with 26 rifles, 9 boxes of ammunition, engineering materials, spare parts for machine guns, telephone equipment, and bombs as booty. From the other fronts, there is nothing to report.

"Announcements from the German General Government.

BERLIN, June 26. (Official report from this afternoon.)

'Western theater of war.

The hand-to-hand combat, which had been raging for days without cease to oust the enemy from our positions, those he occupied north of Souchez and halfway between Souchez and Neuville, has ended. Last night the last French were driven out of our trenches. Last evening the enemy still attempted significant reinforcements to attack, both on either side of the Lorette heights and south of Souchez; but in vain. At Souain in Champagne, we partially blew up the enemy positions; east of Perthes, the French themselves destroyed a portion of their own positions due to unsuccessful mine detonations. West of Combres on the Meuse heights, fierce fighting occurred. On both sides of the Trench, the French attacked four times and always with fresh troops over a front breadth of about 3 kilometers. Each time they were halted by our fire. Where the enemy reached our trenches, they were beaten back with great losses in hand-to-hand combat. A counterattack led to the capture of an advanced enemy position west of the Trench; there the enemy still holds a small section of trench he conquered on June 20. The enemy made a few fruitless attacks on our outposts at Leintrey east of Lunéville. Since the first day of the great battle at Arras, our aviators have been contesting the enemy's air supremacy. Both sides have made sacrifices. Ours were not in vain: for several days we have achieved good success.

Eastern theater of war.

Württemberg regiments stormed some Russian positions south-east of Oglenda, north of Prasnyscz, and on both sides of the Murawka brook and maintained their positions, despite several, also strong, counterattacks. The spoils consist of 636 prisoners and 4 machine guns.

- Southeastern theater of war.

The army of General von Linsingen is making good progress on the northern bank of the Dniester. At Halicz, the enemy still occupies the right bank. Since the start of his attack across this river on June 23, this army has taken 3,500 prisoners. Between the Dniester and the area east of Lemberg, the pursuit continues.
