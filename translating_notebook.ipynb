      "A TRUE STORY.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to get rid of a troublesome journalist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The reign of terror that the cruel Germans have now imposed for nearly nine months in unfortunate Belgium has found a new victim in the person of Mr. Joset, a newspaper editor from the province of Luxembourg, a man of great merit who played a significant political role in his province up until the outbreak of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the moment of the occupation of Belgium, the German military authority listed Mr. Josen among the suspicious persons who needed to be specially monitored. He remained on guard, knowing well that the Germans would seize any opportunity to arrest him, accuse him of espionage, and let him share the fate of so many unfortunate fellow citizens who have fallen under Prussian bullets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weeks and months passed. The Germans waited in vain for an opportunity that never came to \"settle the matter\" with this courageous yet cautious and prudent man. So they decided to resort to one of those cowardly and dastardly methods with which they know how to handle masterfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a month ago, Mr. Josen planned to go to the Netherlands. He traveled to Arlon, where he asked the captain in charge of the Kommandantur for a pass. The captain received Mr. Josen at his office very politely; after examining his papers, he promised to give him a pass. Then he suddenly stands up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me for a moment; I need to go give an order; I'll be right back at your service.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He leaves and lets Mr. Josen alone in the office. A little later, he returns, sits at his desk, and signs the visitor's pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the Kommandantur's stamp?\" he suddenly shouts and throws the papers piled in front of him all over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The stamp is missing!\" he roars. \"You have stolen it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he throws himself on Mr. Josen; two gendarmes quickly join him at his call. The prisoner is searched while his arms are held. And - how could it be otherwise? - the stamp was found, or rather a gendarme pulled it out from one of the outer pockets of the poor Belgian journalist.\n",
      "\n",
      "He protests and shouts in vain! He is arrested and led in chains to the Arlon prison. At the same time, a search of Mr. Josen's house is ordered. And there, as only the Germans can find, a secret cipher code is discovered; they also \"discover\" the draft of a cipher telegram, which is immediately deciphered with the key, containing important military information destined for the allied command!\n",
      "\n",
      "The matter is settled! A few days after his arrest, Mr. Josen appears before the German court-martial and is sentenced to death for high treason!\n",
      "\n",
      "This sentencing caused great turmoil among the population. Immediately, a petition was circulated, adorned with hundreds of signatures, begging for mercy for the condemned. The brave act of the population made an impression on the executioners, and they dared not carry out the sentence. The death penalty was commuted to life imprisonment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Matin,\" which does not even know the real name of its protégé—a telling sign—proves once again that it does not wish to be counted among the newspapers which well-bred people tend to deal with.\n",
      "\n",
      "We state the following solely to clearly highlight the pitifulness of its attack on the German judicial system:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the trial where the Belgian journalist Camille Joset from Arlon was sentenced on April 15, 1915, for the theft of an official stamp to three years in prison and for espionage to death, the first offense played only a subordinate role. The fact that Joset provided secret information about German troop movements to a hostile state, which he openly admitted in all detail during his interrogation and in the clemency plea addressed to the Herr Generalgouverneur, was decisive. As an aggravating circumstance, it was also taken into account that the convict enjoyed special trust from the German authorities, as a result of which he enjoyed sweeping judgments, and that he abused this trust in a disgraceful manner by secretly planning a trip to France. If the imposed death sentence was nonetheless commuted to life penal servitude through clemency, the convict owes it solely to the fact that he showed sincere remorse for his crime and that from the beginning of the war, he managed to render significant services for the general welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "We leave it to everyone's sense of justice to form an opinion on the venomous means with which the honor of German officers and officials is sullied.\n",

The battles on the western bank of the canal to the northwest of Ypres, which we mentioned yesterday, ended in a very costly defeat for the enemy. To the east of the canal, north of Ypres, he made futile attacks. The bombardment of the fortress of Dunkirk continues. Between the Meuse and the Moselle, infantry battles only took place in the area of Ailly and Apremont. All French attacks failed and cost the enemy very heavy losses. In response to the shelling of our rest areas behind the front, we launched several shells into Reims on April 29th. The enemy can easily avoid a bombardment of Reims, as he is well aware of the reason for our actions. Yesterday, the enemy again lost three aircraft. To the northwest of Thielt, an English aircraft was shot down; another aircraft was brought down and destroyed by our fire near Wieltje, northwest of Ypres. The third, which was part of an enemy squadron, had to land at Nieder-Sulzbach.\n",

Enemy attacks at Kalvaria and to the southwest of there were repelled with significant losses for the Russians. Here we captured another 350 men. However, the Russians succeeded in overrunning a German outpost company southwest of Augustowo at night and inflicted severe losses. East of Plock and on the southern bank of the Pilica, we repelled weak Russian attacks.\n",

However, we thwarted his attempts and forced him back to within 500 meters of the coastline, where he found protection from his fleet. We inflicted extraordinarily heavy losses on him. We completely thwarted an enemy attempt to land troops in the Gulf of Saros under the protection of part of his fleet. From the other battlefields, there is nothing significant to report.\n",

Consequently, the number of Russians captured on the Galician front has increased to approximately 70,000 since May 2. We captured 38 cannons, including 9 heavy pieces.\n",

Yesterday morning, supported by the fleet, they launched an attack in the Sedd el Bahr region. The battle continued until late afternoon and was favorable for us. Our counterattacks drove the heavily losing enemy back to their former landing site. On the left flank, some of our forces pursued the enemy to the Sedd el Bahr landing site, raining bombs on the fleeing enemy. In Azerbaijan, around Dilman, small encounters occurred between our reconnaissance units and Russian militias. On the other fronts, nothing of significance occurred.\n",

      "The French sent considerable forces yesterday to break through our lines north of Arras and in the Priest's Forest. In recent days, the enemy had approached the front Neuville-Roclincourt, near Arras, by means of trenches. We therefore expected an attack on our lines, even more so because all attempts to drive us further northward from our positions had failed. This attack came yesterday afternoon, after an artillery preparation lasting several hours. Brave Rhenish and Bavarian regiments inflicted a complete defeat on the enemy, who suffered exceptionally heavy losses. In the Priest's Forest, the French only succeeded in taking a few of the foremost, weakly occupied trenches. Besides that, the enemy's attack failed in its objectives there as well. Near Ostend, a coastal battery shot down an enemy aircraft. With a few shells, our artillery once again destroyed the railway arch bridge of Dammerkirch; only a few days ago the French, after months of work, had restored it for use.\n",

Yesterday, the castle and the farm of Piskorowice were stormed, with numerous prisoners falling into our hands. General von Mackensen's army advances amid fierce battles on both sides of Krakowice and towards Oleszyce. The troops under General Boehm-Ermolli, joining the attack, strike the Russians east and southeast of Mosziska, where the enemy in new positions blocks the road to Grodek. South of the upper Dniester, significant Russian forces defend the bridgeheads of Mikolajow, Zydaczow, and Halicz against the allied troops of the army under von Linsingen, while General Pflanzer-Baltin's troops, downstream, stand before Nizniow and Czernelica and hold Zaleszczyki against all Russian attacks. Parts of this army forced the Russians in Bessarabia, between the Dniester and Prut, to retreat once more to Chotin and along the Prut. The number of Russian prisoners from the battles in Galicia since June 12 has increased by a few thousand men yesterday.\n",

      "\"Announcements from the German General Government. BERLIN, June 16. Official report this afternoon. Western front. As a result of the recent Russian defeats, the French and English attacked yesterday at many points on the western front with significant forces. The English succeeded in pushing back our position north of the Bellewaarde Pond, near Hooge, a little. The battle continues there. Two attacks by four English divisions between the street Estaires-La Bassée and the La Bassée canal failed completely. Our brave Westphalian regiments and parts of the guard brought there repelled the attack after bitter life-or-death fighting. This cost the enemy heavy losses. They left a number of machine guns and a mine thrower in our hands. After their defeats on June 13 and 14 at the Lorette Height, the enemy left our position, which the Badeners defended there with extraordinary stubbornness, untouched this time. At Moulin-sous-Touvent the battle continues. An enemy attempt to break through our lines in the Vosges between the valley of the Fecht and the Lauch failed. Only northwest of Metzeral and at the Hilsenfirst is fighting still taking place. Elsewhere all attacks have already been repelled. Eastern front. In the Davina sector (southeast of Mariampol), east of Augustowo, and north of Bolimow, Russian attacks have been repelled. On the Lipowo-Kalwaria front, we gained some ground again. We have taken some places there. 2,040 prisoners and 3 machine guns fell into our hands. Southeastern front. North of the upper Vistula, the troops under General von Woyrsch repelled the Russian attacks on the positions we took from the enemy on June 14. Yesterday the defeated Russian armies tried to stop the pursuit of the allied armies along the whole front between the San, north of Sieniawa and the swamps of the Dniester, east of Sambor. After a hot fight, they were driven out of all their positions by evening at Kieplice (north of Sieniawa) — southwest of the Lubaszów-Zawadówka sector (southwest of Niemirow) — west of Jaworów — west of Ladowa-Wisznia. We continue the pursuit. General von Mackensen's army has captured more than 40,000 Russians and seized 69 machine guns since June 12. The Russians have gained some ground between the swamps of the Dniester and Zurawno. The overall situation in this place is unchanged. CORRECTION: In the report of June 13, a printing error slipped into the 'Eastern front'. The incursion into the Russian position did not take place south, but indeed north of Bolimow, as could be seen from the report of June 12.\"\n",

The large amount of ammunition they expended, and their disregard for the enormous losses that their attacks incurred, could not prevent the French and English from suffering another defeat.

      "German communication, Berlin, 19 June. (Official report of the General Staff) Western battlefield. The latest attacks by the French north of Arras were as unsuccessful as the previous ones. North of the La Bassée canal, a British forward movement was stopped with ease. Near the Loretto height, on both sides of Neuville and northeast of Arras, several French attacks collapsed. We have cleared some trenches of the enemy that were previously lost. In the Argonne forest, we repelled local attacks with the bayonet. At Vauquois, the battles remained undecided. Northeast of Luneville, we took the village of Embermenil, which the French had reinforced and occupied. After destroying all the French defensive works, our troops withdrew to their old positions and brought back approximately 50 French chasseurs as prisoners. In the Vosges, the fight continues at several points in the Fechtdal. At the Hilsenfirst, we captured more than 200 Frenchmen. — Eastern battlefield. In the vicinity of Szawle-Dawina and the Szlawanta sector, Russian attack movements were stopped. We made some progress southwest of Kalwaria. The village of Vac was taken. Southeastern battlefield. The Russians west of the San were driven back to the line of Zapuscie-Ulanow and further to the east over the Tanew-Pauczka line. The attack on the position at Grodek has begun. The Russians, who are still between the Dniester marshes and the Stryj, were attacked and pushed northwards. The attacks continue. Constantinople, 19 June. The General Staff reports: On the Dardanelles front, our artillery fire destroyed the enemy's machine gun positions and important observation points at Ari Burnu on 16 June. An enemy artillery piece was put out of action. One of our regiments on the right wing captured and occupied part of the enemy's trenches. Yesterday, at Ari Burnu and Sedd-ul-Bahr, weak artillery and rifle fire was exchanged, which, however, did not bring about any significant change. Since 14 June, the enemy has used shells that release suffocating gases. Nothing new on the other fronts. The General Government in Belgium\n",

We are equals to England. Now we must regret that we were compelled to help England due to a treaty. There is no longer any doubt that an understanding with Germany would have been much better for Japan’s future. The near future will bring serious complications. We will have to prove that we are a cultural state of the first rank and that we are on the same level of civilization as England and America. It is no secret that we do not need to fear these two powers, for our strength allows us to hold a colony on America's West Coast, which we have long desired. We must stockpile enormous quantities of artillery and munitions. America is now supplying weapons and ammunition to Germany's enemies; perhaps the day will come when Germany will, rightfully, supply us with weapons and ammunition against the United States of North America and against Australia. The German prisoners of war cannot deny that we have treated them chivalrously. Russia, France, and especially England do not treat German prisoners as befits men and heroes. No German who has fallen into Japanese captivity will have any complaint about their treatment by us. We have granted all their wishes and treated German women and children with respect and esteem. The blow we had to deal to Germany will be forgotten, and it can be repaired to Germany's satisfaction in some way. However, we cannot say anything more about that now. It also depends on the strength of German arms. There is no longer any doubt that Germany and Austria will triumph, even if new enemies emerge. On the day of reckoning, we will also be there and show the world that we have the right to call our country a cultural state, from which Germany's current enemies will learn what is meant by chivalry and justice.

Humbert begins by stating with regret that the Russian retreat and the failure of the French offensive have created strong pessimism almost throughout France. He then sharply criticizes the large capitalists, financial institutions, and wealthy corporations. Until now, they have kept all their wealth back, instead of subscribing to the war loans and thereby supporting the government in its work for the good of France. The large capitalist must show trust just as the small citizen and contribute to the country's defense. If necessary, the French government should mobilize these slackers in the financial area. \"Necessary, these bad patriots should be reminded with compulsory measures,\" concludes Humbert, \"that in wartime, the welfare of the homeland is the highest and only law.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "of the General Government in Belgium.\n",
      "\n",
      "(HUNTING REGULATIONS.)\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Hunting Year. Right to Hunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hunting year runs from March 1 to the last day of the following February.\n",
      "\n",
      "German officers, medical officers, veterinary officers, and officials of officer rank\n",
      "may go hunting.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Fenced Hunting Grounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continuously and completely fenced hunting grounds do not belong to hunting areas; hunting there is only allowed with the permission of the owner or his authorized representative.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a newly erected fence is clearly intended only for the purpose of excluding a specific plot from hunting, it need not be respected. The \"Kreischef\" has the authority to decide on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Bird Trapping, Pheasant and Duck Breeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bird trapping is forbidden from November 15 to September 14 of the following year. From September 15 to November 14, only the trapping of thrushes with birdlime is permitted; however, a permit from the \"Kreischef\" is required for this. The trapper retains ownership of the caught thrushes. (Shot thrushes are the property of the hunter.) From November 15, no snares in which birds could still be caught may be present.\n",
      "\n",
      "In special cases, the \"Kreischef\" can grant pheasantry owners a permit to catch a specified number of pheasants for breeding purposes. The caught pheasants may not be sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owners of enclosed breeding facilities may catch wild ducks within them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ban on bird trapping issued for the Antwerp fortress area remains effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Blinding of Birds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blinding birds, using and displaying blinded birds, as well as peddling, trading, and organizing singing contests with blinded birds is prohibited.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Trapping of Rabbits and Predators.\n",
      "\n",
      "With special permission, persons without a hunting license may be allowed to trap wild rabbits — but only with ferrets and nets — as well as predators, using traps and snares. The \"Kreischef\" grants the permit.\n",
      "\n",
      "When those granted the right to trap venture out, they must carry their permit, which specifies the limited duration and designated area, written in their name. The trapper retains ownership of the caught rabbits. The hunting authority decides on the ownership of caught predators.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Shot and Struck Game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shot game is the property of the hunting leaseholder, who is compensated only at the price set under No. 16. (Rabbits and predators do not count as game in this sense.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The hunter is entitled to take over the game he has bagged at the set price. Hunting trophies (antlers, horns, etc.) are his property.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game or the amount to be paid for it must be handed over by the hunter to the hunting authority, who, against a receipt, gives it to the mayor to pass on to the hunting leaseholder. In the French regions, it must be given to the mayor, who uses it for charity. If it is not possible to hand it over to the leaseholder in the Belgian regions, the proceeds must benefit the Belgian Red Cross.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proceeds from struck game, of which the owner cannot be determined, must be used in the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Game Tag.\n",
      "\n",
      "A game tag must be attached to each piece of game given to the mayor.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Game Import Certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Game imported from Germany and abroad must bear a clearly distinguishable mark. Customs officers must issue a game import certificate, stamped with the service seal, for each imported piece of game. The game import certificate must be securely attached to each piece of game with a cord, and its ends must be sealed with the official service seal to prevent fraudulent use.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. Game Trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Civilians may only sell and trade shot game when each piece is provided with a game tag or game import certificate. Only thrushes and rabbits do not need a game tag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hunters, hunting officials, and all other military personnel may trade without restriction.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. Game Prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "For game taken over by the hunter or hunting official, the following prices are paid:\n",
      "\n",
      "a) red deer (weighed eviscerated and unskinned) per kg. M 0.80\n",
      "b) roe deer per piece M 20.00\n",
      "c) pheasants per piece M 2.00\n",
      "d) ducks per piece M 1.50\n",
      "e) hares per piece M 2.80\n",
      "f) woodcocks per piece M 2.00\n",
      "g) black grouses, male and female per piece M 5.00\n",
      "\n",
      "17. Black Game.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proceeds from black game, which the hunting official allocates to troop kitchens, infirmaries, etc., are used to cover the costs of wild boar hunts. The selling price is set as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Black game (weighed in the hide)\n",
      "under 50 kg per kg M 0.80\n",
      "over 50 kg per kg M 0.65\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is a surplus at the end of the hunting year, it is transferred to eligible municipalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "18. Permissible Hunting Times.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shooting of game is permitted at the following times:\n",
      "\n",
      "a) male red and fallow deer from 16.8. to 31.1.\n",
      "b) female red deer from 16.8. to 30.11.\n",

      "g) woodcock and black grouse from 16.9. to 31.1.\n",
      "h) female pheasants, woodcocks, and black grouse from 16.10. to 31.12.\n",
      "i) ducks from 1.9. to 15.2.\n",
      "j) snipes from 1.9. to 31.12.\n",
      "k) thrushes (see trapping period in No. 8) from 15.9. to 31.1.\n",
      "l) black game throughout the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "19. Time when Wild Game Can Be Sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Game may not be offered for sale or sold 14 days after the close of the hunting season for the particular type of game.\n",
      "\n",
      "21. Powers of the Governors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Governors have the authority:\n",
      "\n",
      "a) to delay the opening of the hunting season for hares, partridges, pheasants, and woodcocks taking into account the state of the harvest by no more than 14 days;\n",
      "\n",
      "b) to completely prohibit the shooting of roe bucks, to limit the number, or to make it dependent on special permission.\n",
      "\n",
      "22. Damage Caused by Game.\n",
      "\n",
      "The German military authorities or persons allowed to hunt under these regulations do not pay compensation for damage caused by game.\n",
      "\n",
      "23. Penal Provisions\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Offenses are punished by the military commander or military courts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Whoever hunts or traps game or birds at a prohibited time or in a manner forbidden by the aforementioned provisions or without being authorized (see exception under lit. B),\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Whoever does not carry the hunting license or permit or refuses to show it upon request of the military responsible for protecting the hunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Whoever sells or trades game within the prohibited times according to Nos. 18 and 19 or without the game tags or import certificates as prescribed in Nos. 13 and 14.\n",
      "\n",
      "B. All hunting offenses committed with snares or similar equipment are further prosecuted by Belgian courts according to the penal provisions contained in Art. 8 of the Jacht Act of February 28, 1882.\n",
      "\n",
      "C. The penalties pronounced by the military commanders or military courts (lit. A.) can amount to a maximum of 5 years imprisonment or a fine of up to 6000 marks. Both penalties can also be imposed simultaneously. Confiscation of tools used by the offender, whether owned by them or not, is permitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "24. Previous Laws and Decrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Belgian laws and decrees remain in force as far as they do not conflict with the provisions of this Decree.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hunting regulations of August 11, 1915, amended on September 17, 1915 (Law and Decree Journal pages 915 and 1087), and the Decree of October 5, 1915, \"on bird blinding\" (Law and Decree Journal, page 1165) are hereby repealed.\n",

      "Even now, as has happened repeatedly before, the attacks by the French and English army units, supported by yellow, brown, and black troops, are being used as a pretext to spread fantastic rumors, which all lack any true foundation, about an impending evacuation of Belgium by the German troops. The aim of this endeavor couldn't be clearer. There is an attempt to stir unrest among the Belgian population and to distract them from their regular activities by making them see the immediate future as uncertain, thereby undermining the basis of order and contentment. Irresponsible agitators have not even refrained from attempting to persuade workers, who could earn a good wage after a rather long period of unemployment, to abandon their work. — As with previous similar occasions, I again urge the active and wiser elements of the population, in their own interest, in the most explicit way, not to believe those false rumors and not to let their peace and regular livelihoods be disturbed. Once again the near future will teach, with good reason, why I have issued this admonition. The authorities under my command have been instructed to track down the spreaders of false reports and to punish them severely. I ask the clear-sighted and industrious elements of the population to remain convinced that I and my administration, taking into account other duties to be fulfilled, are constantly striving to better care for the welfare of the area entrusted to me than those who sow hate and encourage resistance, which I will not tolerate.

      "The claim of the British Government that the violation of Belgian neutrality caused its intervention in the current war has already been shown by the statements of Mr. Edmond Grey to be unsustainable. The moral indignation with which the German invasion of Belgium has been exploited by the English side to incite neutral countries against Germany is further elucidated in a new and peculiar way by certain documents discovered by the high command of the German army in the archives of the Belgian general staff. Contents from the dossier titled: ENGLISH INTERVENTION IN BELGIUM reveal that as early as 1906, plans were provided for sending a British Expeditionary Force to Belgium in the event of a Franco-German war. According to a recently discovered document dated April 10, 1906, sent to the Belgian Ministry of War, the Belgian general staff, together with the British military attaché in Brussels, Lieutenant Colonel Barnardiston, had during this time, and on the latter’s initiative, in repeated consultations, drawn up detailed plans for joint operations against Germany by a British expeditionary force of 100,000 men with the Belgian army. This plan was approved by the head of the British general staff, who also gave information regarding the strength and organization of the expeditionary force, places for embarkation, and time estimates for the crossing, which were provided to the Belgian general staff. Based on this information, the Belgian general staff meticulously prepared for the transport, deployment, accommodation, and maintenance of the British troops in Belgium, down to the specifics of interpreters and Belgian police officers to be made available to the British, and the necessary maps were to be provided. \n",
      "\n",
      "The English supplies were to be moved to Antwerp as soon as the North Sea was cleared of German warships. According to the English attaché, a Belgian espionage service was to be set up in the Rhineland. \n",
      "\n",
      "These military documents found a valuable complement in a report sent to the Minister of Foreign Affairs by GREINDL, who for many years was the Belgian ambassador to Berlin. This report, which is also among the secret papers, reveals with great insight the ulterior motives underlying the English proposal and draws attention to the precarious situation in which Belgium had placed itself by choosing to favor the powers of the \"Entente\". In this extensive report, dated December 23, 1911, GREINDL states that the plan for the defense of Belgian neutrality in an Entente war does not address the question: What measures would need to be taken if Germany were to violate Belgian neutrality? Though an attack by France through Belgium was equally likely. The Minister elucidated word by word the following: \n",
      "\n",
      "From the French side, there exists not only the danger from the south of Luxembourg. Our entire border is threatened. To respond to this, we should not make assumptions; we have positive data. \n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of a sweeping movement along the north formed part of the \"Entente Cordiale\" plans. Otherwise, the plans for the defense of Vlissingen would not have caused such outbursts in Paris and London. They did not hesitate to explain why they wanted the river to remain undefended. It was to allow the easy transport of an English garrison to Antwerp. Thus, to secure an operational base here for an offensive in the direction of the Lower Rhine and Westphalia and to drag us with it, which would not have been difficult. After surrendering our national forts, we would have deprived ourselves of every means to resist the demands of our questionable protectors whom we so imprudently permitted. The simultaneously treacherous and naive proposals from Colonel Barnardiston at the closing of the \"Entente Cordiale\" make clear what the situation would have been if it had become apparent that we did not allow ourselves to be intimidated by the asserted threat of closing the Scheldt estuary. The plan was not discarded, but was modified in such a way that the English auxiliary corps would not be disembarked on the Belgian coast but in the nearest French ports; this was confirmed by Captain Faber's disclosures, which have not been refuted, nor have the reports from newspapers that confirmed or supplemented them in parts. This English army landing in Calais or Dunkirk would not go across our border to reach Germany. It would quickly penetrate our territory from the northwest, providing them with the advantage of immediately taking action, meeting the Belgian army, should it dare to engage in a battle in an area without any fortifications to rely on; seize provinces rich in resources; in any case, prevent our mobilization or only allow it after obtaining definite commitments from us, ensuring that such mobilization would be in England's and its allies' favor. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is absolutely necessary to draw up in advance the plan of operations which the Belgian army would follow in this scenario, both for our military defense and for the direction of our foreign policy should war break out between Germany and France. \n",
      "\n",
      "These explanations, coming from a source unbiased by any presuppositions, reveal that Belgium concluded a one-sided agreement to the benefit of the powers of the \"Entente\" and that at some point it even considered violating Dutch neutrality. Moreover, it results from this that by listening to English instigations, the Belgian Government had made a serious breach of its duties as a neutral power. Compliance with its duties would have required the Belgian Government to provide for the possibility of a violation of Belgian neutrality by France in its defense plans and, in such a case, also to conclude agreements with Germany similar to those made with France and England. \n",
      "\n",
      "The documents found constitute documentary evidence of the Belgian understanding with the \"Entente\" powers, which fact was known by the German authoritative services before the war broke out. They justify our military action and confirm the information regarding the French intentions obtained by the high command of the German army. \n",
      "\n",
