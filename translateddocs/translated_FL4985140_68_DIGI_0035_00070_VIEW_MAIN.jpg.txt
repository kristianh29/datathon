The "Court of the Mobile Stage Commandantur" of the 4th army has issued the following announcement:

2000 marks (two thousand marks) reward.

On September 2, 1915, the body of the castle owner Henry d’Udekem d’Acoz, who disappeared on May 25, 1915, from the castle Laeke-Boschen (Ruddervoorde near Beernem) was found in a forest by the road from Beernem to Wijagene, where it was buried. It appears that a murder was committed here. A few days earlier, on Saturday, August 28, 1915, the gamekeeper of the castle, Kamiel Dierix, disappeared without a trace; he is suspected to be involved in the murder of the castle owner.

Consequently, a reward of 1000 marks (one thousand marks) is offered for the arrest of the gamekeeper Dierix or for providing reliable information about the reason for his disappearance or about his whereabouts.

Notifications must be submitted to the "Court of the Mobile Stage Commandantur."

Furthermore, an additional 1000 marks (one thousand marks) are offered for the person whose information will shed light on the murder of the castle owner d’Udekem d’Acoz.

If necessary, the amount of these rewards will be distributed at the discretion of the Stage Commandant in Ghent.

Age: 52 years; height: approximately 1.75-1.80 m; hair: dark blond, graying; eyes: blue, large reddish-blond graying full beard; dressed in hunter's vest, clogs, dark trousers, cap.
