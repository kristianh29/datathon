"NOBLE PEOPLE, UNARMED,

E.H.O.. December 11, 1916.

TO THE Municipality of Merelbeke.

In addition to the postal service that has been opened for the family members of civilian workers, a charitable collection has been organized on the request of the Commander of the workers' battalion No. 4, which was set up in the month of October, on the occasion of the New Year celebration.

Since the rural municipalities undoubtedly want to contribute to this collection for the workers who were conscripted from their area, the mayors have immediately arranged to share the necessary information with their councils.

It is not about preparing a package for each worker, but the donations (especially warm clothing and garments, gingerbread, tobacco) are collected at the town hall and packed into boxes under the supervision of the military authorities, which will then be loaded onto a wagon. The distribution of the items will take place at the destination by a commission of workers.

Furthermore, the restrictions on postal service shipments remain in force, meaning that money, letters, perishable goods, and items that pose a fire hazard are not to be included. â€” The Command will also announce when the collection must be concluded (presumably by the coming week).

The Stage Commander.
