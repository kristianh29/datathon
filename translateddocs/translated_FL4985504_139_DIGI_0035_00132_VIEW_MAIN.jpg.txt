The municipalities must immediately provide all their streets and places with names and the houses with sequence numbers.

An address book of residents must be made in which all the inhabitants of the municipality are recorded alphabetically with an indication of their residence. This must be completed in the same manner as has already been done in the city of Ghent.

From a window facing the street of every house, a sign must be placed showing the first and last name and the day of birth of all persons (men, women, children) who reside in the house. A model of this sign is added herewith.
