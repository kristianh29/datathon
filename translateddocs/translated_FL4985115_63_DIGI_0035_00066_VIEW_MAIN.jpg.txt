Starting November 1, 1915, the supervision, as it has existed for Belgians born between 1892 and 1897, will be extended to all male Belgians born between 1885 and 1898 (both years inclusive).

However, the personnel (not the officers) of the former inactive civic guard who have completed their 30th year of life will be released from supervision.

On this occasion, I repeat that the supervision was only implemented to establish the presence of those required to report and to prevent their evasion.

This does not imply any conscription into the German army nor any deportation into war captivity.

Brussels, October 1915.
The General-Governor in Belgium,

Freiherr von BISSING,
Colonel-General.
