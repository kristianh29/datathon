Excerpt from the Decree

on Hunting and Bird Trapping
in the Territory

of the General Government in Belgium.

(HUNTING REGULATIONS.)

1. Hunting Year. Right to Hunt.

The hunting year runs from March 1 to the last day of the following February.

German officers, medical officers, veterinary officers, and officials of officer rank
may go hunting.

6. Fenced Hunting Grounds.

Continuously and completely fenced hunting grounds do not belong to hunting areas; hunting there is only allowed with the permission of the owner or his authorized representative.

If a newly erected fence is clearly intended only for the purpose of excluding a specific plot from hunting, it need not be respected. The "Kreischef" has the authority to decide on this.

8. Bird Trapping, Pheasant and Duck Breeding.

Bird trapping is forbidden from November 15 to September 14 of the following year. From September 15 to November 14, only the trapping of thrushes with birdlime is permitted; however, a permit from the "Kreischef" is required for this. The trapper retains ownership of the caught thrushes. (Shot thrushes are the property of the hunter.) From November 15, no snares in which birds could still be caught may be present.

In special cases, the "Kreischef" can grant pheasantry owners a permit to catch a specified number of pheasants for breeding purposes. The caught pheasants may not be sold.

Owners of enclosed breeding facilities may catch wild ducks within them.

The ban on bird trapping issued for the Antwerp fortress area remains effective.

9. Blinding of Birds.

Blinding birds, using and displaying blinded birds, as well as peddling, trading, and organizing singing contests with blinded birds is prohibited.

10. Trapping of Rabbits and Predators.

With special permission, persons without a hunting license may be allowed to trap wild rabbits — but only with ferrets and nets — as well as predators, using traps and snares. The "Kreischef" grants the permit.

When those granted the right to trap venture out, they must carry their permit, which specifies the limited duration and designated area, written in their name. The trapper retains ownership of the caught rabbits. The hunting authority decides on the ownership of caught predators.

12. Shot and Struck Game.

Shot game is the property of the hunting leaseholder, who is compensated only at the price set under No. 16. (Rabbits and predators do not count as game in this sense.)

The hunter is entitled to take over the game he has bagged at the set price. Hunting trophies (antlers, horns, etc.) are his property.

The game or the amount to be paid for it must be handed over by the hunter to the hunting authority, who, against a receipt, gives it to the mayor to pass on to the hunting leaseholder. In the French regions, it must be given to the mayor, who uses it for charity. If it is not possible to hand it over to the leaseholder in the Belgian regions, the proceeds must benefit the Belgian Red Cross.

The proceeds from struck game, of which the owner cannot be determined, must be used in the same way.

13. Game Tag.

A game tag must be attached to each piece of game given to the mayor.

14. Game Import Certificates.

Game imported from Germany and abroad must bear a clearly distinguishable mark. Customs officers must issue a game import certificate, stamped with the service seal, for each imported piece of game. The game import certificate must be securely attached to each piece of game with a cord, and its ends must be sealed with the official service seal to prevent fraudulent use.

15. Game Trade.

Civilians may only sell and trade shot game when each piece is provided with a game tag or game import certificate. Only thrushes and rabbits do not need a game tag.

Hunters, hunting officials, and all other military personnel may trade without restriction.

16. Game Prices.

For game taken over by the hunter or hunting official, the following prices are paid:

a) red deer (weighed eviscerated and unskinned) per kg. M 0.80
b) roe deer per piece M 20.00
c) pheasants per piece M 2.00
d) ducks per piece M 1.50
e) hares per piece M 2.80
f) woodcocks per piece M 2.00
g) black grouses, male and female per piece M 5.00

17. Black Game.

The proceeds from black game, which the hunting official allocates to troop kitchens, infirmaries, etc., are used to cover the costs of wild boar hunts. The selling price is set as follows:

Black game (weighed in the hide)
under 50 kg per kg M 0.80
over 50 kg per kg M 0.65

If there is a surplus at the end of the hunting year, it is transferred to eligible municipalities.

18. Permissible Hunting Times.

The shooting of game is permitted at the following times:

a) male red and fallow deer from 16.8. to 31.1.
b) female red deer from 16.8. to 30.11.
c) roe deer from 16.8. to 31.12.
d) hares from 16.10. to 31.1.
e) partridges, quails from 1.10. to 31.12.
f) male pheasants from 16.10. to 31.12.
g) woodcock and black grouse from 16.9. to 31.1.
h) female pheasants, woodcocks, and black grouse from 16.10. to 31.12.
i) ducks from 1.9. to 15.2.
j) snipes from 1.9. to 31.12.
k) thrushes (see trapping period in No. 8) from 15.9. to 31.1.
l) black game throughout the year.

19. Time when Wild Game Can Be Sold.

Game may not be offered for sale or sold 14 days after the close of the hunting season for the particular type of game.

21. Powers of the Governors.

The Governors have the authority:

a) to delay the opening of the hunting season for hares, partridges, pheasants, and woodcocks taking into account the state of the harvest by no more than 14 days;

b) to completely prohibit the shooting of roe bucks, to limit the number, or to make it dependent on special permission.

22. Damage Caused by Game.

The German military authorities or persons allowed to hunt under these regulations do not pay compensation for damage caused by game.

23. Penal Provisions

A. Offenses are punished by the military commander or military courts:

1. Whoever hunts or traps game or birds at a prohibited time or in a manner forbidden by the aforementioned provisions or without being authorized (see exception under lit. B),

2) Whoever does not carry the hunting license or permit or refuses to show it upon request of the military responsible for protecting the hunt.

3) Whoever sells or trades game within the prohibited times according to Nos. 18 and 19 or without the game tags or import certificates as prescribed in Nos. 13 and 14.

B. All hunting offenses committed with snares or similar equipment are further prosecuted by Belgian courts according to the penal provisions contained in Art. 8 of the Jacht Act of February 28, 1882.

C. The penalties pronounced by the military commanders or military courts (lit. A.) can amount to a maximum of 5 years imprisonment or a fine of up to 6000 marks. Both penalties can also be imposed simultaneously. Confiscation of tools used by the offender, whether owned by them or not, is permitted.

24. Previous Laws and Decrees.

The Belgian laws and decrees remain in force as far as they do not conflict with the provisions of this Decree.

The hunting regulations of August 11, 1915, amended on September 17, 1915 (Law and Decree Journal pages 915 and 1087), and the Decree of October 5, 1915, "on bird blinding" (Law and Decree Journal, page 1165) are hereby repealed.

Brussels, the Xth April 1916.
The General Governor in Belgium,

Freiherr von BISSING,
Generaloberst.
