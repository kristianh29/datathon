Regarding meetings and associations.

According to the decree of January 16, 1915, concerning meetings and political associations (Law and Decree Gazette No. 34, page 119), I decree as follows:

Art. 1.

Open-air meetings are prohibited.

Art. 2.

Public meetings are prohibited if political matters are to be discussed and deliberated upon. In all other cases, prior authorization is required.

Art. 3.

For private meetings, prior authorization is also required.

Instead of authorization, prior notification is sufficient if the meetings concern purely religious, social, scientific, professional, or artistic purposes.

Art. 4.

For meetings with social purposes and sessions of authorities within their jurisdiction, neither authorization nor prior notification is required.

Art. 5.

Authorized to grant authorization (articles 2 and 3) and to receive notifications (article 3) is the Local Commander, and in his absence, the District Chief. The authorization must be requested at least 5 days in advance, and the notification must be communicated at least 3 days in advance. The place, time, and purpose of the meeting must be indicated.

Art. 6.

Responsible for violations of the provisions under articles 1 to 3 are not only the organizers, the arrangers, and the leaders, but also the participants in the meetings.

Art. 7.

All clubs and associations with political purposes or for the discussion of political matters are closed. It is prohibited to re-establish such clubs and associations. Punishable are the leaders, founders, and members of these associations.

Art. 8.

Violations of this decree are punishable by up to 1 year or by a fine of up to 9000 marks. Both penalties can be imposed simultaneously.

The military courts and military commanders are competent for the judgement.

Brussels, May 26, 1916.

The General-Governor in Belgium, Freiherr VON BISSING, Colonel General.
