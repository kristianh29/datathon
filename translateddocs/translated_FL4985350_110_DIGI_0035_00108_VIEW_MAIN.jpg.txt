In order to ensure an even distribution of all supplies in the Stage Area and with regard to the regulation of May 29 of this year (Regulation Sheet No. 37, pages 279-281), I stipulate the following:

1. — After harvesting the grains, threshing and storing them in attics must begin immediately. The threshing must be carried out according to the instructions of the competent Command, and it must be expedited as much as possible. In case of negligence, both the negligent parties and the mayors will be punished, unless they have not taken sufficient care in supervising the process. Threshed grain stocks must be delivered to the warehouses designated by the mayor. Delivery must take place immediately, at the latest 3 days after threshing.

No farmer is allowed to keep more than what has been threshed within 3 days: This excludes the seed:

160 kilos rye | 160 kilos barley | for one hectare. 170 kilos wheat | 150 kilos oats

These quantities may remain in the possession of the farmers, with the obligation that each farmer must report to the mayor which grain types and how many hectares they want to sow in the fall of this year, or in the spring of the following year.

The bookkeeping of the grain supplies delivered is the responsibility of the municipal administration (mayor and aldermen). At all times, the quantity of stocks available in the warehouses must be evident from the books. 

For proper bookkeeping, mayors and aldermen are responsible.

Of all grain types, municipalities must deliver at least one-fourth of the harvest by September 15 of this year, the second fourth by November 1 of this year, the third fourth by December 1 of this year, and the remainder by January 1, 1917.

§ 2. — Regarding the payment and milling of the bread grains returned to the municipalities and the distribution of the flour to municipal members and bakers, the Stage Commands, after the directive of the Stage Inspection, will issue further provisions.

§ 3. — The BARLEY shall be delivered by the municipalities to a central location yet to be designated, and it will be bought and distributed at a price yet to be determined.

4. — Of the delivered OATS, the mayors shall withhold one kilo per day per horse — around 240 kilos — from October 1, 1916, to May 31, 1917, and distribute the rightful ration to horse owners on a monthly basis according to a schedule determined by the competent Command. The mayors must also keep meticulous records thereof.

§ 5. — The RAPESEED must be threshed immediately after harvesting and delivered to the municipal administration. Farmers may withhold 10 kilos per hectare as seed.

6. — The yield of the GRASS harvest (first and second cut) must be stored or stacked in sheaves according to the instruction of the Stage Commands in the proportion of one-third to two-thirds. One-third remains with the farmer, the other two-thirds remain at the disposal of the mayors, who are responsible for proper storage. They will receive further instructions on usage from the Commands.

The same applies to the straw; however, farmers may retain half of it, the other half remains at the disposal of the mayors, who must also act according to the Commands’ instructions.

§ 7. — Additional instructions regarding the use of other field crops will follow later.

§ 8. — Previously issued regulations that conflict with this regulation or with that of May 29 of this year are hereby repealed.

§ 9. — Sections 6 and 7 of the regulation of May 29 of this year also apply to this regulation and to all further provisions issued by the Stage Commands and municipalities as a result of this regulation.

E. H. O., June 15, 1916. The Stage Inspector, von UNGER, General of Cavalry.
