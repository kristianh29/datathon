Upon leaving the area of the General Government, travelers may not take with them any written communications or printed materials of any kind, apart from identity papers and passports, unless they possess special written permission from the General Government, the Political Department, the Department for Banking, or the "Chief of Administration" with the General Governor. The granting of permission to take business papers and similar documents is the exclusive authority of the Commissioner-General for the banks and branch offices of the Department for Banking in Antwerp and Liège, as well as the Department for Trade and Industry with the "Chief of Administration". — For everything else, travelers may have the documents they need sent to their destination by post. Any action in violation of the above regulation is punishable by up to one year of detention or imprisonment or a maximum fine of 4,000 marks. In addition to fines, imprisonment may also be imposed. These penalties are handed down by the military court and, in lighter cases, by the competent German court based on a police verdict.
