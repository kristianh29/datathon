By virtue of paragraph 4 of the regulation of the
Imperial General Government of July 8, 1916, regarding the

reporting of stocks of COPPER and TIN

(Law and Regulations Gazette No. 239, page 2445), I hereby order
the following to be implemented:

The declaration lists (yellow for the stocks of classes
1 to 24, green for the stocks of Classes 25 to 27),
must be immediately collected by the obligated persons at the
municipal offices and, on site,
at the latest by AUGUST 31, 1916,

filled out to the best of their knowledge and belief and returned.

Insofar as a person required to declare has doubts about a regulation,
they must personally come to the Artillery barracks
LIER, room No. 55, or send an expert there, to request the necessary instructions
before filling out the declaration list. I reserve the right to check the completeness and accuracy of the reports.

I draw attention to the necessity that the lists
must be filled out in such a way that they accurately indicate the
stock existing on AUGUST 1, 1916, that they must be signed by the obligated persons,
and furthermore, that single households remain temporarily exempted from the obligation of declaration. Failure to declare stocks or making false or insufficient reports intentionally or through negligence, as well as a simple attempt of counteraction, are punishable with up to 5 years imprisonment and a fine of up to 20,000 marks.

Lier, August 1, 1916. Freiherr QUADT,

Major and Commander of the Southeast Section
of the Antwerp Fortress.
