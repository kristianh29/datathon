Ordinance

on the keeping of pigeons.

Repealing my previous announcement with the same title
from 6.10.1915 (Law and Ordinance Gazette No. 130, p. 1209), I order the following:

A.

1.

Owners of any pigeons are required to keep their pigeons locked in their coops daily until 1 PM. From 1 PM until sunset, the pigeons can be released. From 2 PM to 5 PM, all coops (lofts) must be open and all pigeons must be able to fly out. It is forbidden to keep individual pigeons separated from the general loft.

2.

For all pigeons, including those born during the year, lists organized by coop must be submitted, according to previous models and in duplicate, by October 15 each year, to the mayor of the municipality. These lists must be submitted by November 1 to the district chief or, in their absence, to the commander. One copy will be returned to the mayor by the German authorities after stamping, to be handed over to the pigeon keepers; for them, it serves as proof of registration. The lists must be affixed to the door of the coop.

3.

All pigeons — even the young ones as soon as they leave the nest — must wear a closed, seamless, unsoldered, non-removable leg band. Exempted are those pigeons born from October 15 to February 15 of the following year; these must be killed as soon as they can fly.

4.

Societies and individuals who sell or issue leg bands to pigeon keepers must submit a list of the number of leg bands procured for 1916, with precise details of the leg band markings, to the mayor of their municipality, who will forward it by July 31 to the district chief or the commander for submission to the General Government. Furthermore, they must keep an accurate list of sold or issued bands. The owner of each pigeon must be easily identifiable through the leg band.

From October 15, 1916, the procurement of leg bands by societies or pigeon keepers is prohibited; from that date on, the leg bands will be exclusively provided and issued by the General Government.

Pigeons born during the year and thus only registered on October 15 must be marked by red coloring of the right wing on both sides.

5.

Pigeons not accustomed to the coop must also be made incapable of flying by significantly shortening the 6 largest flight feathers of one wing.

6.

The provision under No. 3 does not apply to heavy-flying ornamental or fancy pigeons, such as croppers, trumpeters, and peacocks, etc. Such pigeons will be stamped by the pigeon control commands, insofar as this has not yet occurred.

7.

Pigeon keepers, into whose coops pigeons fly, must kill the pigeons and report in writing to the mayor of their municipality, submitting the leg band and description of the pigeon.

Pigeon keepers, from whose coops pigeons have strayed and remain missing, must report this in writing to the mayor within 4 days. These reports must be forwarded to the competent military authorities (district chief, commandantur).

8.

It is forbidden to sell live pigeons, transfer them from one coop to another, or to trade or exchange them in any manner. Therefore, only slaughtered pigeons may be brought to the street or market.

As an exception, upon request submitted to the mayor, the transfer of pigeons to the new residence may be allowed during relocation by the district chief or the commander, but such transfer must take place under military supervision and in compliance with provision No. 5.

9.

If during inspection by the military authorities fewer pigeons are found than listed in the registration records, the pigeon keeper must explain this by, if necessary, presenting the leg bands.

10.

Where no other penal provisions — especially those concerning espionage — are applicable, violations of this ordinance are punishable by up to one year of imprisonment or a fine of up to 10,000 marks; in addition, forfeiture of the entire pigeon stock of the convicted person may be pronounced.

Forfeiture of the entire pigeon stock must be pronounced when the perpetrator intended to evade surveillance by the military authorities. Furthermore, when pigeons capable of flying and not accustomed to the coop are left with unclipped wings or kept isolated. Additionally, when soldered or otherwise subsequently attached leg bands were applied.

Judgments are to be rendered by the German military courts and military authorities.

12.

Special provisions for areas belonging to the General Government in the districts of Kortrijk and Tournai:

For areas belonging to the General Government in the districts of Kortrijk and Tournai, except for the canton A, instead of No. 1, the following special provision applies:

Owners of any pigeons are required to keep their pigeons permanently locked in the coops. The flight openings must be securely closed or surrounded with a fixed grille. No pigeons may be kept isolated.

Brussels, June 22, 1916.

The Governor-General in Belgium,

Freiherr von BISSING

Generaloberst.
