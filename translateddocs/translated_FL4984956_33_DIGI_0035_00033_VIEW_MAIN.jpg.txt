"Notification from the German General Government.

BERLIN, June 18. (Official announcement from this afternoon.)

Western theater of war.

The enemies continue their vain attempts to break through our front north of Arras. The English suffered a new defeat north of the La Bass√©e canal; their assault troops were mowed down, only a few soldiers could escape by fleeing. The French have penetrated our frontline at a few points east of Angres, south of Souchez, and north of Ecurie. Just north of the Loretto heights, we voluntarily evacuated a section of trench that came under the enfilading fire of the enemy artillery. All other attackers have been repelled. In the combat area north of Arras, since June 16, we have captured 17 officers and 647 men. The bloody losses of the French are comparable to those of the battle in Champagne. In the Argonne forest, we repulsed weak forward movements of the enemy. Near Vauquois, local fighting occurred. In the Vosges, the battles west of Metzeral are still ongoing.

Eastern theater of war.

German cavalry drove advancing Russian detachments back across the Szymsza sector east of the Cytowiany-Szawle road. A strong Russian attack on the Dwina failed.

Southeastern region.

On both sides of Tarnogrod, the allied troops pushed the enemy back to the drainage basin of the Tanew at night. The army under General von Mackensen drove the defeated Russians back into the positions prepared near Grodek (line Narol-Miasto-Nagierow-brook Wereszyca to its mouth in the Dniester). On the Dniester front, the situation northeast of Stryj remains unchanged.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 17. The headquarters reports: On the Dardanelles front, the artillery fire of our left wing destroyed an enemy aircraft on the morning of June 15, while it was flying over our positions near Ari Burnu; it fell behind the enemy trenches. Yesterday, nothing significant happened near Ari Burnu and Sedd-ul-Bahr. Our coastal batteries in the straits took the enemy's artillery positions, troops, and a transport column under fire near Sedd-ul-Bahr. They blew up a munitions wagon of said column. On the other fronts, no noteworthy military operations took place.
