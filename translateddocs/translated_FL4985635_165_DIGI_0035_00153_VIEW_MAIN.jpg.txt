Every resident is required to save food waste: the fatty (being waste from meat, bones, fish, etc.) and the dry (peels, vegetables, bread, etc.), each in a separate bucket or container.

Each household must therefore have two buckets or containers, which must be kept clean.

The collection will take place for this part of the district on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9 a.m.

The waste is used for raising pigs, whose meat will be half for the supply above the meat ration of the city's residents and the other half for the military, provided payment to the city.

The collection is carried out by the Municipal Sanitation Service under police supervision. Each cart will be equipped with a bell.

Residents will place the buckets or containers in the hallway or courtyard.

Residents who do not keep rabbits or chickens are required to deliver the waste.

Residents who deliver a lot will receive extra above the usual ration, a portion of a pig for free.
