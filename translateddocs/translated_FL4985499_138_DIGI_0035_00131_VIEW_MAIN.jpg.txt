To conserve the available coal supplies of municipalities that need coal to produce gas or electricity, the following is decreed:

1. — All shops and other commercial establishments with illuminated shop windows visible from the street must extinguish their lighting at 7 PM. 

The shop windows may not be illuminated in any other way.

On December 24, 25, and 31, 1916, the lighting may continue until 9 PM.

2. — Pharmacies are exempt from the regulation under point 1.

3. — All bars, cafés, theaters, cinemas, concert halls, and other public and private meeting places must close so that at the latest by 10 PM all gas or electric lighting ceases.

Exempt are those bars and meeting places that, by special permission, have already remained open beyond the general police hours.

4. — Street lighting is to be regulated so that at least 50% of the lighting used up to now is conserved.

5. — Violations will be punished with a fine of up to 500 Marks and imprisonment of up to 2 months, or with one of these penalties, unless stricter penalties apply according to existing laws and regulations.

The establishments mentioned under point 3 can also be closed permanently.

6. — This ordinance takes effect on December 6, 1916.
E.H.O. November 23, 1916.
