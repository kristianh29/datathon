Ordinance concerning travel across the entire territory of the General Government

The travel ban under Ordinance of May 1, 1917, G. G. H. 3514/1, is hereby revoked.

Henceforth, one may travel again from the parts of the district of Tournai, which belong to the General Government and are located near Pérwelz and Leuze, from the districts of Ath, Soignies, Thuin, Philippeville (with the exception of the areas of Givet and Fumay), from the part of the district of Dinant that lies south of the Anhée-Yvoir-Leignon border point between the districts of Dinant and Marche, as well as from the district of Neufchateau and from the district of Mons which belongs to the staging area, to the other parts of the General Government area and vice versa without a travel permit (Verkehrsschein) as was previously allowed (i.e. using other means of transport than motor vehicles and bicycles).

Also, one may travel under the same conditions without a travel pass (Passierschein) to the district of Mons which belongs to the staging area. However, those who wish to move to this area for relocation must possess a permit.

Furthermore, one may not travel by rail from areas where no pass requirement exists to the train stations Bertrix, Orgéo, Ardoisiéres, Mortehan, and Herbeumont, located on the railway line from Bertrix to Herbeumont (district of Neufchateau), or from these stations to areas where no pass requirement exists, without possessing a pass.
