For the execution of the registration of Copper and Tin, ordered by the Imperial General Government in Belgium on July 8, 1916, notifications are issued by the competent local command posts during the period

AUGUST 9 TO 20, 1916

These notification forms must be received, according to ยง 2 of the ordinance, by persons and companies obliged to register, during office hours from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 5 to 7 p.m.

To enable accurate registration of the quantities and to prevent all difficulties and inquiries, it is essential that the person obliged to register personally receives the notification form from the competent local command post, which, if necessary, can be informed by the municipal government. Companies must appoint a competent person, knowledgeable about the factory operations, to handle this matter. There will be an opportunity to provide all necessary information to those obliged to register regarding any unclear destinations, if necessary after an inspection of the quantities by an expert.

The undersigned notification forms, completed according to the state of August 4, must be personally returned to the competent local command post during the period

AUGUST 21 TO 30

during the indicated office hours. Here, the notification forms will be reviewed.

While I note that ordinary households are not obliged to register for the moment, I warn the others not to delay registration, or deliberately or negligently provide false or incomplete registration. I therefore draw the attention of the interested parties to the penalties set by ยง 4 of the ordinance and point out that even the attempt to act in this manner is punishable.

Brasschaet, August 3, 1916.

Major General and Section Commander.
