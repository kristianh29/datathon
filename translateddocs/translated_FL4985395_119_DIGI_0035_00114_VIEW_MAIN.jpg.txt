To better protect the agricultural lands, I decree as follows:

1. — Whoever takes agricultural or horticultural products, parts of them, or those already harvested and still lying in the field, without being authorized to do so, will be punished with imprisonment.

2. — An imprisonment of no less than 4 weeks will be applied if multiple persons participate in the theft, or if upon apprehension, resistance is offered to the rightful owner or to the public security service officer, which includes the civilian security patrols organized in the municipalities with the German authority's consent, or if one of the aforementioned persons is injured.

3. — According to the above provisions, whoever steals domestic animals used in agriculture or forestry outside the stables will be punished.

4. — Anyone who, without being authorized or an officer of the public security service, which includes the civilian security patrols organized in the municipality with the German authority's consent, enters fields used for land or horticulture, will be punished with a fine of up to 1000 marks or imprisonment for up to 3 months.

5. — Every attempt is punishable.

6. — If a violation of the above regulations is committed by a person under 18 years, the responsibility rests on the person legally responsible for him, who can be punished with the same penalty.

7. — Stricter German or existing penal provisions are not affected by this ordinance and remain in force.

8. — The sentencing will be carried out by the German military courts or military administrations, in less severe cases by means of an immediate decision.
