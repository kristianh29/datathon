As a repeal of the proclamations of December 1, 1915 (Proclamations for the Stage Area of the 4th Army No. 15, pages 122-123), of April 15, 1916 (Proclamations for the Stage Area of the 4th Army, No. 32, pages 232-234), and of August 9, 1916 (Proclamations for the Stage Area of the 4th Army No. 46, pages 360-362), the following is established for the stage area of the 4th Army concerning straw flax, processed flax, and tow (clods):

ARTICLE 1. — Anyone who has stocks of straw flax, processed flax, or tow (clods) in storage is required to report the quantities, broken down by type and owner, and storage location to the local administration (mayor and aldermen) of the municipality where the storage site is located by the 3rd of each month.

The municipalities must report the available stocks of straw flax, processed flax, and tow, specifying owners and storage locations, to the Stage or Regional Commands by the 5th of each month.

ARTICLE 2. — The following maximum prices are set for processed flax and tow (clods) from old and new harvests:
1) For water-retted flax: a) 250 to 350 francs, depending on quality, per bale of 104 kilos gross or 103 kilos net of Kortrijk flax.
b) 190 to 250 francs, depending on quality, for 100 kilos of Flemish blue flax.

2) For field-retted flax (field-retting): 130 to 180 francs, depending on quality, for 100 kilos of hackled grass-retted flax from any origin.

3) Tow (combed): a) 80 francs for hackled (reprocessed) clods of best quality.
b) 100 francs for pure natural clods of best quality.
c) 120 francs for ends of best quality.
d) 140 francs for combed (hackled) clods of best quality.

For straw flax, the price corresponds to the highest prices set for processed flax.

If quality is lower and processing is inferior, the maximum prices are reduced accordingly.

ARTICLE 3. — Any transportation of straw flax, raw hemp, processed flax, or tow (clods) without a permit from the Stage Inspection (Economic Committee) or the flax offices in Kortrijk and Lokeren is prohibited.

Processed flax or clods may only be sold to:

The sale of straw flax for processing may occur, with permission from the "Economic Committee" or the flax offices in Kortrijk and Lokeren, to flax processing facilities.

ARTICLE 4. — The stocks of straw flax, processed flax, and clods from old and new harvests must be surrendered at the request of the competent Stage or Regional Commands to the official offices indicated in Article 3, points 1 and 2. If the sale price is not agreed upon, the price will be determined by the authorities named in Article 3, points 1 and 2, together with a Belgian expert.

ARTICLE 5. — Punishable by up to 3 years' imprisonment and a fine of up to 30,000 marks or one of these penalties are:
1) Those who do not declare their stocks to the local administrations accurately, timely, or correctly.
The same penalties apply to mayors and aldermen who report inaccurate stock declarations to the Stage or Regional Commands, knowing or having reason to know under the circumstances that the reports are incorrect.

2) Those who exceed the fixed maximum prices.
3) Those who solicit others to enter into contracts exceeding the maximum prices or offer themselves for such contracts.

4) Those who transport straw flax, processed flax, or clods without permission.
5) Those who sell straw flax, processed flax, or clods to parties other than the authorities indicated in Article 3, points 1 and 2, or without permission to flax processing facilities, or otherwise alienate them.

7) Those who destroy or make unusable stocks of straw flax, processed flax, or clods.

The stocks related to the offense must be confiscated.
