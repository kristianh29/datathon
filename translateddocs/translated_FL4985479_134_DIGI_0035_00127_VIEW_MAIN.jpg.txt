It has been found that the lists of unemployed, which are largely drawn up according to the lists of the National Committee, are not accurate. Those lists of the National Committee are not checked: investigations have proven that abuse and fraud have occurred with the assistance.

The municipalities are therefore obliged to prepare a list of all male persons in their area, from 17 to 45 years old, including information on whether those persons are unmarried or married, how many children they have, whether they are completely or partially unemployed, and where they work, how many days per week they work, and at what wage. These lists must be made as accurately as possible, and the mayors are held responsible for their accuracy. The Commandant's Office will review these lists, and inaccuracies will be punished with the utmost severity.

This list must be submitted by the 20th of this month; changes are to be reported on the 1st and 15th of every month (for the first time on December 1st).

The Stage Commandant.
