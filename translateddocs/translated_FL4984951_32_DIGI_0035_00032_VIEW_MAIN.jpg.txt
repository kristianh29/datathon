VIENNA, June 18. (Official report of yesterday.)
Russian battlefield.

Even yesterday, the defeated Russian armies could not hold their ground anywhere. In central Galicia, they continued to retreat along the entire front in a northeasterly and easterly direction, leaving strong rearguards to cover their retreat. The allied armies pursued them closely. North of Sieniawa, our troops advanced over Cieplice and Cewkow; yesterday, they drove a significant Russian force, still on Galician soil, back over the state borders, inflicting heavy losses. The allied troops farther east occupied Lubacz√≥w, expelled the Russians from Niemirow after a fierce battle, and advanced towards Janow. On the Lemberg line, troops under Boehm defeated strong Russian rearguards near Wolczuchy late in the evening, driving them back over the Wereszyca, and at midnight stormed the western front of Grodek. South of Grodek, the western bank of the Wereszyca was also cleared of the enemy. The general situation south of the Dniester remains unchanged. Italian battlefield.

On the Isonzo front, our troops repelled several attacks at Plava once again, causing great losses to the enemy. In the rocky area of Krn, the mountain troops continued the fighting. Nothing noteworthy happened on the Carinthian border yesterday. In Tyrol, enemy offensive movements were halted at the Tillia-Cher-Joch, near Tre Sassi, Buchenstein in the Tofane area, and on Mount Coste, east of Folgaria.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 16. One of our flyers saw a battleship resembling the "Agamemnon" in the Kefale Bay, near Imbros. The deck was almost underwater; the rear smokestack and the rear mast had completely disappeared into the water. Nothing significant happened on the other fronts.

BERLIN, June 17. (Official.) On the night of June 15-16, our fleet airships conducted an attack on the Northeast coast of England. They bombarded a coastal fort with bombs, setting numerous industrial facilities on fire, including a blast furnace, which were partially destroyed. The airships were intensely fired upon, especially by a coastal battery, which was attacked and silenced. The airships were unharmed.

BERLIN, June 18. The claim in the French official report of June 16, 11 PM, that the Reims Cathedral was shelled with incendiary shells, is false. The shelling was largely aimed at the Qost barracks, as well as the batteries near the railway junction north of Reims, which were taking aim at our positions.
