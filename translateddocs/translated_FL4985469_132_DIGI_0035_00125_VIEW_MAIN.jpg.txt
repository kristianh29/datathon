The writing No. 6666 from the Higher Command of the Army, Agricultural Division, states:

The Police Commissioner of Merelbeke is informed:

In the order of November 15, 1916, regarding the use of chicory roots, it was decreed that the entire yield of roots, immediately after removing the first leaves for salad, must be sold to the Stage Command, specifically to the appointed ALBERT MASUREEL in Merelbeke.

MASUREEL now informs us that the following growers of chicory have not yet delivered any roots:
BAETENS Petrus, DICK Petrus, DE BRUYNE Stephanus, DE BRUYCKER Remi, DOBBELAERE Joseph, DERAEDT Petrus, DE VOS Gustave, LEYMAN August, LEYMAN Gustave, LATEUR Maurice, LEMAITRE Joseph, SEMOISE Alfons, SCHOLLAERT Leon, SCHEPENS Oscar, VANDENBROUCKE Alfons, VLEURINCK Alois, VANDEVELDE Guillaume, VANDAELE Prosper, VANDER STICHELEN Alfons, VANDEPUTTE Alfons, VANDEVELDE Damien, VERDONCK Joseph, VANDENBULCKE August.

You are requested to order the growers to proceed immediately with delivery, otherwise they will be penalized.

THE MANAGEMENT:
Z. V.

Lieutenant.

Having seen this report and the list given by Mr. MASUREEL, I request, by this means, those who have not yet delivered their chicory roots to immediately start delivering them to Mr. Albert MASUREEL, as otherwise serious unpleasantness will await the uncooperative.

Drukkerij Antonius, Jos. Dooreman-Volekaert, Merelbeke.
