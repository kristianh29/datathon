Regulation concerning employment creation for the unemployed.

1.

Works that directly or indirectly aim to keep the unemployed occupied for compensation (works for the unemployed) must be reported to the mayor of the municipality where they are undertaken before they are executed. The mayor is obliged to forward the notification to the civil commissioner (Zivilkommissar) of the canton.

The civil commissioner ensures the decision by the president of the civil administration of the province.

The execution of works for the unemployed without approval is prohibited. Works for the unemployed, the execution of which was already begun upon this Regulation coming into effect, must be reported by June 1, 1916, at the latest.

2.

Anyone who lets works for the unemployed, which have not yet been approved, be executed, or causes their execution, shall be punished with imprisonment of up to three years and a fine of up to 20,000 marks or one of these penalties. The mayor who neglects to make the notification to the civil commissioner or allows the commencement of unapproved works for the unemployed, undergoes the same punishment.

Exceptions to the provisions of paragraph 1 are permitted by the General Governor.

4.

The competent authorities are the German military courts and the German military authorities.

5.

This Regulation comes into effect with its proclamation.

Brussels, May 2, 1916.
