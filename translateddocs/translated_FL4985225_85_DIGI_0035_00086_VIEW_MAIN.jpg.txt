Even now, as has happened repeatedly before, the attacks by the French and English army units, supported by yellow, brown, and black troops, are being used as a pretext to spread fantastic rumors, which all lack any true foundation, about an impending evacuation of Belgium by the German troops. The aim of this endeavor couldn't be clearer. There is an attempt to stir unrest among the Belgian population and to distract them from their regular activities by making them see the immediate future as uncertain, thereby undermining the basis of order and contentment. Irresponsible agitators have not even refrained from attempting to persuade workers, who could earn a good wage after a rather long period of unemployment, to abandon their work. â€” As with previous similar occasions, I again urge the active and wiser elements of the population, in their own interest, in the most explicit way, not to believe those false rumors and not to let their peace and regular livelihoods be disturbed. Once again the near future will teach, with good reason, why I have issued this admonition. The authorities under my command have been instructed to track down the spreaders of false reports and to punish them severely. I ask the clear-sighted and industrious elements of the population to remain convinced that I and my administration, taking into account other duties to be fulfilled, are constantly striving to better care for the welfare of the area entrusted to me than those who sow hate and encourage resistance, which I will not tolerate. Brussels, July 27, 1916. The General-Governor in Belgium Freiherr Von BISSING, Generaloberst.
