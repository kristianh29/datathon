BERLIN, May 3. (Official report from
this afternoon.)

Western Theater of War.

- In Flanders, we successfully launched attacks on both sides of the Poelkappelle-Ypres road and captured the farms "The Fortune", southeast of St. Julian. In Champagne, our well-executed mine explosions caused significant damage to the enemy position between Souain and Perthes. Between the Meuse and Moselle, only artillery was active yesterday. At Hartmannswillerkopf, the French unsuccessfully attempted to attack our position on the summit last night. Yesterday, a French aircraft landed at Hundlingen, west of Sargemund; both occupants were captured. A German aircraft squadron successfully attacked, evidently, the aircraft hangar and the station of Epinal.

Eastern Theater of War.

In the pursuit of the Russians fleeing towards Riga, we captured 4 cannons, 4 machine guns, and took 1,700 prisoners south of Mitau yesterday. This brings the total number of prisoners to 3,200. Southwest of Kalvaria, Russian attacks failed with heavy losses for the enemy: the Russians were driven back over the Scesupa and left 330 prisoners in our hands. The Russians also suffered a severe defeat northeast of Skierniewice: in addition to numerous dead, they lost 100 men as prisoners.

Southeastern Theater of War.

In the presence of the supreme commander, Field Marshal Archduke Friedrich, and under the leadership of General von Mackensen, the allied troops broke through the entire Russian front in Western Galicia yesterday after bitter battles, from near the Hungarian border to the mouth of the Dunajec in the Vistula, and pushed it back everywhere. The enemy troops that could escape are being closely pursued by the allied armies in full retreat to the east. The spoils of victory cannot yet be estimated, even approximately.
