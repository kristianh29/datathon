EB. H. O. 7 Mei 1916.

To the Municipality of Melle.

1. In order to feed horses, it is requested to cut all young shoots from poplars, lindens, maples or sycamores, ashes, alders, willows, etc. These clippings must be dried slightly, then they are cut and mixed with oats or hay and thus serve as food for the horses. Until 23 June, report how many kilograms are available.

2. The expansion of pig breeding as much as possible is mandatory. One can register at the Town Hall for feed.

It is also mandatory to harvest as much hay as possible, and to let the animals graze the meadows only by plots, and to reseed the grazed spots.

3. Persons who have given up their horse to the German Authority, or have delivered their workshop, and who wish to buy a horse must register at the Town Hall tomorrow Sunday morning.

4. The attention of farmers is drawn to the new regulations for breeding bulls.

The Mayor,

Baron Van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie
