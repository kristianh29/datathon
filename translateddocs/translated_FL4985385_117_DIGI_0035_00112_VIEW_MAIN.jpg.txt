I lift the regulation of June 15 concerning the treatment of this year's harvest and determine as follows:

I. — For the acquisition of the grain harvest, harvest books must be kept in every municipality, separately for rye, wheat, maslin (rye and wheat), spelt, and oats. (The barley harvest is regulated by a special ordinance of July 11, 1916.)

In these books, which will be provided by the agricultural section of the Etappen-Inspection against cost payment, each farmer must report:

a) Name,

b) Area of grain in question in 1916,

c) Estimate of the harvest thereon,

d) Number of actually harvested sheaves,

e) Area to be planted in the harvest year 1917,

f) Amount of seed retained for that,

g) Amount of threshed and delivered grain.

The initial setup of the harvest books concerning a-b, will be done by the agricultural exploitation offices at the Etappenkommandanturen.

Once these books have been handed over to the various municipalities, the mayors and aldermen are solely responsible for their accurate and proper maintenance.

The books must be submitted to the Kommandanturen at intervals of 3-4 weeks for a few days in order to be inspected.

Data that occurs during this time should be recorded immediately after the books are returned.

2. — For the delivery of the grains, the Etappenkommandanturen will determine special delivery days for each municipality, which will follow each other in intervals of about 14 days. Likewise, the Kommandanturen will determine the place of delivery.

The grain threshed by various farmers must be cleaned as quickly as possible. It is expressly forbidden to stack large quantities of uncleaned threshed grain. Neither may the cleaned grain be stacked, but it must be delivered on the next delivery day. Therefore, no farmer may withhold grain stocks.

3. — ALL THRESHED GRAIN must be delivered. However, it is allowed to withhold the waste grain resulting from threshing, that is to say:

for rye 5% for spelt 3%
for wheat 2% for maslin 2%
for oats 3% 

Furthermore, seed for the cultivation of fields in the coming year may be withheld, that is to say for every hectare to be planted with:
rye 160 kilos spelt 250 kilos

wheat 170 » maslin 170 »
oats 150 » 

The fields to be planted for 1917 with the various fruits, as well as the seed allowed for them, must be recorded in the harvest book for each farmer by the mayor. The grain retained for seed must be placed in special bags, marked with a note with the inscription:

"... kilos of seed for ... hectares of rye (wheat, oats, spelt, maslin)."

to identify the contents as seed, so that in any later inspection this grain is immediately recognized.

All remaining grain must be delivered. At least one-fourth of the harvest of all grain types must be delivered by September 15, the second quarter by November 1, the third quarter by December 1, and the rest by December 31, 1916.

The grain must be delivered in bags of the military administration. For the first delivery, municipalities will pick up the necessary bags at the Kommandantur, and later can receive the necessary bags for the next delivery with each delivery. Written proofs must be handed over for the received and delivered bags.

4. — During the deliveries, the municipalities will receive their assigned bread grain against payment. The total amount for the time from September 15, 1916, to September 14, 1917, amounts to 44 kilos per resident. The municipalities must take care of the storage of their bread grain. The mayors and aldermen are responsible for its orderly and careful storage and must protect it against spoilage, theft, fire, and any other damage, and keep records of how much is on hand or where it has gone. This stock should be distributed in intervals of 2 months and in quantities corresponding to these intervals.

The Kommandanturen will monitor this bread grain management as well as its storage.

For the milling of the distributed bread grain, the Etappenkommandantur will designate the necessary mills in each municipality, which must complete the milling within 14 days. Occasionally exceptions must be requested from the Etappen-Inspection. Municipalities are responsible for the precise distribution of the bread grain and flour.

In the meantime, all mills are closed except those working for the Relief Committee.

For the purpose of processing the waste grain retained by farmers in whole or in part, the Kommandanturen may open mills for a specific time and make them available. Millers must keep records of the different quantities given to them for milling and submit their books to the Kommandanturen upon request after the time allotted for milling has passed.

5. — In the oat deliveries, municipalities will also receive their entitled feed oats against payment.
The amount designated for one horse is 1.5 kilos per day or 550 kilos, calculated for a year.
Municipalities may immediately distribute the received feed oats to horse owners. However, these must store the received feed oats separately and identify them with notes stating:
"Feed oats for (number) horses."

6. — The grain will be paid for immediately upon delivery to the mayors, who will pay the amount received to the various farmers according to their deliveries. The highest prices have been set as follows:
For 100 kilos of rye 30.00 Fr.
For 100 kilos of wheat 36.00 Fr.
For 100 kilos of oats 38.00 Fr.
For 100 kilos of spelt 36.00 Fr.
For 100 kilos of maslin 30.00 Fr.

The highest prices are only valid for impeccable quality, while a corresponding price reduction will be made for inferior and insufficiently cleaned grains. The mayors must separate grain of this type from the impeccable quality upon delivery.

7. Violations of this ordinance or the regulations issued on its basis by the Etappenkommandanturen will be punished with a fine of up to 10,000 marks or imprisonment for up to 3 years. Both penalties can be applied simultaneously, and goods used contrary to the above regulations can be confiscated.

Competent authorities are the German military courts and military administrations.
