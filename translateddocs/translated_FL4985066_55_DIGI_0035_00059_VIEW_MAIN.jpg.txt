**NOTICE**

It is hereby reiterated that in the parts of Belgium placed under German administration, only the orders of the Governor-General and the authorities subordinate to him are valid from the time of the establishment of this administration.

Any decisions taken since that time or still issued by the King of the Belgians and the current Belgian ministers have absolutely no legal force within the reach of the German administration in Belgium. I shall employ all means at my disposal to ensure that administrative power is exercised only by the German authorities appointed in Belgium. I expect Belgian officials to carry out their duties in the country's best-understood interest, as long as I do not require any direct promotion of German military interests.

Salaries paid to Belgian officials by former Belgian administrations without the knowledge or against the will of the German administration will be confiscated.

Brussels, January 4, 1915.

The Governor-General in Belgium,

Baron VON BISSING,

Generaloberst.
