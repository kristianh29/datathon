VIENNA, May 30. - (Official report of
yesterday.)

Northern Theater of War.

Again yesterday and last night, the
Russians launched strong attacks at various
points on the Lubaczewka and east of
Radymno, which were repelled with heavy
losses for the enemy. On the east bank
of the San River, the allied troops advanced
under constant fighting. At the upper Dniester,
as well as near Drohobyez and Stryj, we have
approached the enemy to assault distance.
Russian forward movements were generally
bloodily repulsed. Otherwise, the situation is
virtually unchanged.

Southwestern Theater of War.

Italian troops have reached the position
Ala and Primiero. Otherwise, nothing happened
on the Tyrolean and Carinthian border. In the
coastal area, smaller battles have started. At
Karfreit, an Italian battalion was scattered.
At Plava, a forward movement by an enemy
division, north of Gorizia, was repelled
five times. Last night, some seaplanes
launched another attack on Venice; under
very heavy rifle and gunfire, they dropped
numerous bombs mostly on the arsenal,
causing several large fires, including an explosion
at Fort Nicolo. Last night, a large foreign
steamer struck a mine at the entrance of
the Gulf of Trieste and sank.
