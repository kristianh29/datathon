Based on my Decrees of June 30 and July 23, 1915 (no. 5) concerning the grain harvest of 1915, as well as my Decree of August 28, 1915 concerning grain and flour from earlier years, I have, on the proposal of the "Zentral Ernte Kommission," established the highest prices for the sale of threshed grain, flour, bran, and bread as follows:

for wheat from warehouse or mill, delivered...fr. 38.28 per 100 kg
" rye " " " 26.58 " "
" barley " " " 24.30 " "
" maslin " " " 28.77 " "
" unhulled spelt " " "
" wheat bran from mill delivered " 22.00 " "
" maslin bran " " " 20.00 " "
" rye bran " " " 18.00 " "
" wheat flour to bakers or users delivered " 48.05 " "
" maslin flour " " " 36.29 " "
" rye flour " "
" wheat flour ground to 60% or finer, to pastry bakers delivered " 80.00 " "
" rye flour ground to 60% or finer, to pastry bakers delivered " 65.00 " "
" wheat bread to users delivered " 90.00 " ker.

These highest prices become effective from March 1.

The "Provinzial Ernte Kommissionen" is authorized, upon request or after consulting the mayors, to establish a lower maximum price for wheat bread for some municipalities, as well as maximum prices for bread for which rye flour is used.

For the sales of producers' wheat and rye to the National Relief and Food Committee, the highest prices established in my announcement of August 10, 1915 (no. 4a) remain in effect.

Brussels, February 23, 1916.
