2) Objects made of at least 3/4 of a metal not seized, whose individual parts are inseparably connected to each other (e.g., riveted, pressed together, welded, etc.).

3) Objects intended for religious purposes that are located at or in church buildings and other religious places.

The Department of Trade and Industry, office for raw materials (Abteilung für Handel und Gewerbe, Rohstoffverwaltungsstelle) can, upon written request in special cases, e.g., for objects of artistic or historical value, allow further exceptions, as well as exemption from the prohibition of Article 5.

Article 4. — Obligation to declare.

The objects listed in Article 2 must be declared on the designated declaration forms, no later than 30 September 1917, at the Department of Trade and Industry, office for raw materials. The stock present on the reference day (Article 1) serves as the measure for the declaration.

The forms are obtainable at the “Orts-” or “Abschnittskommandanturen”; the quantities present must be declared on them for each of the metal types listed on the declaration card in net kilogram weight. A separate card must be filled out for each class.

If determining the weight involves special difficulties, such as for metals built into walls, a conscientious estimation of the weight suffices.

Quantities smaller than 10 kg per class, from the same owner, do not need to be declared; they must, however, be handed over in the same manner as the objects that fall under the obligation to declare.

Article 5. — Obligation to remove and deliver.

The objects specifically mentioned in Article 2, Article 4, paragraph 4, which by 30 September 1917 have not voluntarily been sold to the “Zentral-Einkaufsgesellschaft für Belgien m. b. H., Abteilung Metalle,” Kunstherlevingslaan 30, in Brussels, must be removed and delivered upon invitation by the Department of Trade and Industry, office for raw materials, within the time set for that purpose. By the act of delivery, ownership is transferred to the German military administration.

The person delivering the objects shall receive a receipt for the delivered objects; the Reich Compensation Commission (Reichsentschädigungskommission) determines compensation according to existing guidelines.

The invitation to remove and deliver allocated objects may be given through general or special arrangements, with regard to certain industrial branches, enterprises, or districts.

Individuals required to declare are obligated to remove and deliver the pertinent objects.

Article 6. — Supplementary provisions.

Otherwise, the provisions of §§ 3, 4, 7, 9, and 10*) of the Ordinance mentioned in Article 1, as well as the provisions of the Ordinance of 17 June 1917, concerning the extension of the penal provisions of the Regulations issued in connection with the war economy, apply accordingly.

Brussels, 31 July 1917.

The Governor General in Belgium.
