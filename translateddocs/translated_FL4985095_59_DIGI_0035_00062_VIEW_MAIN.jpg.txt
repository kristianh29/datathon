As a result of recent statements in the newspapers concerning the dissolution of the Managing Committee of the Belgian Red Cross,

I hereby decree:

All such authorities, associations, administrations, etc., who previously had official or business relations with the former Managing Committee or received instructions from it, shall henceforth, in matters concerning the Red Cross, only communicate with the Interim Administration of the Red Cross appointed by me, headed by Count B. von Hatzfeldt-Trachenberg, representative of the General Governor for the Belgian Red Cross.

It is designated: Interim Administration of the Belgian Red Cross, Brussels, Koningsstraat, 95.

Brussels, the 16th of April 1915.

The General Governor in Belgium, Freiherr von Bissing, General Colonel.
