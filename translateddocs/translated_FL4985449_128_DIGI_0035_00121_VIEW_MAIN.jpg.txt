"High Command of the 4th Army. - J. Nr. 18959. _E.H.O., September 20, 1916.

It can be assumed that enemy aircraft attempt to set grain stacks on fire by means of bombs.

To this end, it is recommended that the tops of the grain stacks be covered with green leaves or earth so that the stacks take on the color of the ground.

By October 10, 1916, the necessary arrangements must be made.

The High Command.
