Ghent, December 16, 1916.

Circular nÂ° 2 to the Mayors.

In order to save you personally and your barley farmers unnecessary and severe difficulties, you are urgently requested to communicate the following message to your residents in the most effective way.

All farmers and residents of the municipality who still have barley in their possession can still deliver it, WITHOUT risking difficulties because of it.

The agents of the Barley Central will notify the mayor 5 days before the date of this last delivery, and this date will be communicated to the population by the concerns of the mayor.

The payment will be made in the same manner as for previous barley deliveries, on the basis of 45.00 fr. per 100 kg of good and healthy barley.

ALL barley still in possession of a farmer or resident of the municipality after this date will be confiscated, with strict penalties to follow.

Signed: FALK, Captain."
