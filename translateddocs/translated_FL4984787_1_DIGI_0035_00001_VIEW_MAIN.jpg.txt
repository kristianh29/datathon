The "Matin" of Paris writes on May 1915

A TRUE STORY.

How to get rid of a troublesome journalist.

"The reign of terror that the cruel Germans have now imposed for nearly nine months in unfortunate Belgium has found a new victim in the person of Mr. Joset, a newspaper editor from the province of Luxembourg, a man of great merit who played a significant political role in his province up until the outbreak of war.

From the moment of the occupation of Belgium, the German military authority listed Mr. Josen among the suspicious persons who needed to be specially monitored. He remained on guard, knowing well that the Germans would seize any opportunity to arrest him, accuse him of espionage, and let him share the fate of so many unfortunate fellow citizens who have fallen under Prussian bullets.

Weeks and months passed. The Germans waited in vain for an opportunity that never came to "settle the matter" with this courageous yet cautious and prudent man. So they decided to resort to one of those cowardly and dastardly methods with which they know how to handle masterfully.

About a month ago, Mr. Josen planned to go to the Netherlands. He traveled to Arlon, where he asked the captain in charge of the Kommandantur for a pass. The captain received Mr. Josen at his office very politely; after examining his papers, he promised to give him a pass. Then he suddenly stands up and says:

"Pardon me for a moment; I need to go give an order; I'll be right back at your service."

He leaves and lets Mr. Josen alone in the office. A little later, he returns, sits at his desk, and signs the visitor's pass.

"Where is the Kommandantur's stamp?" he suddenly shouts and throws the papers piled in front of him all over.

"The stamp is missing!" he roars. "You have stolen it!"

And he throws himself on Mr. Josen; two gendarmes quickly join him at his call. The prisoner is searched while his arms are held. And - how could it be otherwise? - the stamp was found, or rather a gendarme pulled it out from one of the outer pockets of the poor Belgian journalist.

He protests and shouts in vain! He is arrested and led in chains to the Arlon prison. At the same time, a search of Mr. Josen's house is ordered. And there, as only the Germans can find, a secret cipher code is discovered; they also "discover" the draft of a cipher telegram, which is immediately deciphered with the key, containing important military information destined for the allied command!

The matter is settled! A few days after his arrest, Mr. Josen appears before the German court-martial and is sentenced to death for high treason!

This sentencing caused great turmoil among the population. Immediately, a petition was circulated, adorned with hundreds of signatures, begging for mercy for the condemned. The brave act of the population made an impression on the executioners, and they dared not carry out the sentence. The death penalty was commuted to life imprisonment."

The "Matin," which does not even know the real name of its protégé—a telling sign—proves once again that it does not wish to be counted among the newspapers which well-bred people tend to deal with.

We state the following solely to clearly highlight the pitifulness of its attack on the German judicial system:

In the trial where the Belgian journalist Camille Joset from Arlon was sentenced on April 15, 1915, for the theft of an official stamp to three years in prison and for espionage to death, the first offense played only a subordinate role. The fact that Joset provided secret information about German troop movements to a hostile state, which he openly admitted in all detail during his interrogation and in the clemency plea addressed to the Herr Generalgouverneur, was decisive. As an aggravating circumstance, it was also taken into account that the convict enjoyed special trust from the German authorities, as a result of which he enjoyed sweeping judgments, and that he abused this trust in a disgraceful manner by secretly planning a trip to France. If the imposed death sentence was nonetheless commuted to life penal servitude through clemency, the convict owes it solely to the fact that he showed sincere remorse for his crime and that from the beginning of the war, he managed to render significant services for the general welfare.

We leave it to everyone's sense of justice to form an opinion on the venomous means with which the honor of German officers and officials is sullied.
