Mobilization Etappen-Kommandantur

237/VIII of the 4th A.-J. No. Arb, 6811.

Several Z. A. B. have submitted a proposal for receiving a greater quantity of clothing and equipment. According to the institution dated 7-10-1916, the municipalities must provide clothing in case it is not possible for the family of the conscripted. The charitable collection initiated has resulted in the most lamentable way for the municipalities, yielding a completely poor outcome. Surely, the blame for this poor result must be attributed mainly to the municipal authorities. If the municipal authorities and family members take an interest in the conscripted workers, a number of clothes and clothing items can still be collected. The utterly irresponsible behavior prompts the Kommandantur to employ the strongest measures.

The municipalities have until 3.2.1917 to report how many clothing and equipment items they can still provide to the Z. A. B. conscripts. If the result is deemed insufficient, the Kommandantur will use coercive measures against the municipalities and their members.

The attached list must be submitted by 3.2.17.
