The "Matin" of Paris writes, May 1915

A TRUE STORY.

How to get rid of an annoying journalist.

"The reign of terror that the cruel Germans have introduced in unfortunate Belgium for almost nine months now has found a new victim in Mr. Joset, a newspaper administrator from the province of Luxembourg, a man of great merit who played an important political role in his province immediately before the war.

From the moment of the occupation of Belgium, the German military authority put Mr. Joset on the list of suspicious individuals who had to be supervised closely. He remained cautious, knowing that the Germans would take the smallest pretext to arrest him, accuse him of espionage, and make him share the fate of so many of his unfortunate compatriots who have fallen under Prussian bullets.

Weeks and months went by. The Germans waited in vain for the opportunity, which simply would not arise, to 'settle the matter' of this courageous yet cautious and prudent man. Therefore, they decided to resort to one of those cowardly and despicable methods with which they know how to deal masterfully.

About a month ago, Mr. Joset planned to go to the Netherlands. He traveled to Arlon, where he went to ask for a pass from the captain in charge of the Kommandantur. The captain received Mr. Joset in his office very politely; after examining his papers, he promised him a pass. Then suddenly, he stood up and said:

— Excuse me a moment; I need to issue an order; I will be right at your disposal.

He left and let Mr. Joset alone in the office. A little later, he returned, sat at his desk, and signed the visitor's pass.

— Where is the seal of the Kommandantur? he suddenly shouted, and he threw the papers piled up in front of him into disorder.

— The seal has disappeared! he bellowed, you stole it!

And he leaped at Mr. Joset; two gendarmes rushed at his call. The prisoner was searched while his arms were held. And—how could it be otherwise?—the seal appeared, or rather a gendarme pulled it from one of the outer pockets of the poor Belgian journalist.

It does no good for him to shout, to protest, it is in vain! He was arrested and brought in chains to the prison of Arlon. At the same time, a house search was ordered at Mr. Joset's residence. There too, they discovered—as only the Germans could find—a secret cipher; they also "discovered" the draft of a cipher message, which was immediately deciphered with the cipher key and contained important military information destined for the allied army commanders!

The matter is settled! A few days after his arrest, Mr. Joset appeared before the German court-martial and was sentenced to death for high treason!

This sentence caused a great stir among the population. Immediately, a petition began circulating, adorned with hundreds of signatures, pleading for clemency for the condemned. This courageous act by the population impressed the executioners, and they did not dare to carry out the sentence. The death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment."

The "Matin", which does not even know the real name of its protégé—how characteristic—proves once again that it no longer wishes to be counted among the newspapers with which well-bred people prefer to be associated.

We establish the following only to clearly and explicitly denounce the pitiable attack on the German judicial system:

In the case, where the Belgian journalist Kamiel Joset from Arlon was sentenced, on April 15, 1915, to 3 years in prison for stealing an official seal and to death for espionage, the first offense played only a subordinate role. The fact that Joset provided secret information about German troop movements to a hostile state, which he openly admitted in all detail both during the interrogation and in his clemency appeal to the Governor-General, was decisive. As an aggravating circumstance, it was also taken into consideration that the convict enjoyed special trust from the German authorities, benefited from extensive privileges as a result, and precisely this trust was betrayed in a disgraceful manner by secretly planning a trip to France. If the death sentence was nevertheless commuted to life imprisonment through a pardon, the convicted man owes this solely to the fact that he showed sincere remorse for his crime and that from the beginning of the war he had been able to make himself very useful for the public welfare.

With this, we leave it to everyone's sense of justice to form a judgment on the malicious means by which the honor of German officers and officials is smeared.
