Provisions on delivery.

The items listed in Article 2 under numbers 1 to 18 must be delivered according to municipalities and districts, in accordance with the instructions appended hereto.

In municipalities where persons under the delivery obligation receive an additional invitation, the parties concerned are not exempt from the obligation if they do not receive a special invitation; in this last case, however, they must deliver the affected items simultaneously with their neighbors.

The delivery offices are open daily — except Sundays — from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

The persons concerned must at their own expense transport the items to be delivered to the delivery offices; they must also at their own expense detach fixed or built-in items. The delivery may be done by an agent.

The items are paid for immediately after delivery to the person who brings them in, based on the weight determined at the delivery office and at the price provided for in Article 4 of the Regulation H. G. A. 22928 of July 31, 1917. The person receives a written receipt for the delivered weight and the amount paid for it.

In rented or sublet houses and apartments, the owners, tenants, or subtenants are responsible for the punctual delivery of all items affected by the regulation.

As for houses that have been vacated by their owners, are empty, or occupied by officials of the German military or civilian authorities, special instructions will be given with a view to delivery.

Art collections do not need to be delivered for the time being; they must, however, be reported to the Department for trade and industry, the office for raw materials (Abteilung für Handel und Gewerbe, Rohstoffverwaltungsstelle) in Brussels.

Article 4.

Acquisition of replacement items.

The items listed in Article 2 under numbers 19 to 28 that need to be replaced by others remain temporarily exempt from delivery until December 1, 1917.

For these items, it will be later announced where and when they are to be delivered.

The delivery offices provide information regarding the acquisition of replacement items for the items listed in Article 2 under numbers 24 to 28.

Article 5.
Coercive measures.

Items not delivered in accordance with the regulations will be confiscated by force. After the delivery deadlines have expired, house searches will be carried out.

Reference is expressly made to the penal provisions of § 11 of the regulation of December 13, 1916, as well as to the regulation of July 17, 1917, concerning the extension of penal provisions of regulations issued in connection with the war economy.
