ANNOUNCEMENT

regarding

requisitioned bulk goods.

The great difficulties associated with transporting, arranging, and estimating the requisitioned bulk goods in Belgium, as well as reviewing the receipts, cause the processing thereof to progress slowly. However, since the holders of such receipts have a legitimate desire to draw money now for the continuation of their business, for purchases, or for paying wages, etc., I have established an

ADVANCE FUND AT THE GENERAL GOVERNORATE IN BELGIUM

in Brussels, Wetstraat, 90, which will provide advances on receipts for requisitioned bulk goods. This privilege can be used without distinction by all holders of receipts for requisitioned bulk goods, whether they are Germans, allies of Germany, Belgians residing in the area, or neutrals. The advances are provided without interest.

The Advance Fund will begin its operations on 6th April. The detailed regulations concerning transactions with the fund are available there, at the Head of Civil Administration in the individual provinces, and from the district chiefs. In addition, the operational regulations will be sent to all major banks and smaller banks in the occupied regions of Belgium.

Provision of advances by the Advance Fund does not delay the final payment of the receipts for requisitioned bulk goods, as stated in my announcement of 9th January this year. The intervention of the Advance Fund should rather contribute to expediting the final settlement, as it assists in arranging and examining the submitted receipts and thereby helps to prepare the final settlement.

Brussels, 2nd April 1915.

The General Governor in Belgium
Freiherr von BISSING,
Colonel-General."
