Considering that in some municipalities the potato harvest has yielded only a fairly small quantity, the acquisition of new potatoes for the coming summer must be considered in order to use the potatoes of the new harvest in time.

The Agricultural Committee of East Flanders will provide and sell seeds at a price that will be set later. To gain a reliable overview of the cultivation, the necessary seed, and a basis for the distribution that will take place later, cultivation contracts, even for the smallest areas, must be concluded. The necessary forms for this are delivered to the municipalities. Additional forms can be requested from the Etappen-Kommandantur, Agricultural Department. For each cultivator, 3 forms are to be completed. One of these will remain with the cultivator. The other two must be submitted to the Etappen-Kommandantur, Agricultural Department.

The municipalities are to recruit as many as possible to ensure an extensive cultivation. It will be to the benefit of the municipalities if the missing quantity of this year's potato harvest is settled in this way in due time.

Since the seed must be acquired soon, it is essential that the recruitment of cultivators is completed by 30 November 1916.

The closed cultivation contracts can be submitted immediately to the Etappen-Kommandantur, Agricultural Department, no later than 1 December 1916, at 10 oâ€™clock in the morning.

At the same time, by 1 December 1916, a list of the collective concluded cultivations must be submitted. 

The cultivation is not limited to farmers. Anyone who owns land suitable for potato cultivation can help increase the harvest of new potatoes.

Etappen-Kommandant.
