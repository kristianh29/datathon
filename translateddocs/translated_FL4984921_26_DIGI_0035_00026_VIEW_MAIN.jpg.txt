BERLIN, June 14. (Official report from this afternoon.)

Western theater of war.

We have inflicted a serious defeat on the French on the front between Liévin and Arras. Although our artillery fire repeatedly scattered the enemy attack columns assembled in their storm positions throughout the day, they launched two powerful attacks on our positions on both sides of the Loretto height, as well as on the Neuville-Roclincourt front, in closed ranks towards evening. Everywhere, the enemy was repulsed with heavy losses. All the positions have remained entirely in our possession. Near the Yser Canal, we have repelled relatively weak enemy attacks. Southeast of Hébuterne, the infantry battles did not achieve anything noteworthy. In Champagne, assault movements on the positions we conquered were nipped in the bud.

Eastern theater of war.

We captured some enemy positions near Kuzowinia, northwest of Szawle; 3 officers and 300 men fell into our hands. Southeast of the road from Mariampol to Kowno, our troops stormed the forefront of the Russian lines and captured 2 officers and 313 soldiers.

Southeastern theater of war.

The army of General von Mackensen has left its positions at Czerniawa (northwest of Mosziska) and at Sieniawa and has gone on the offensive over a 70-kilometer front there. The enemy positions along the entire front were taken by storm. Yesterday, we captured 16,000 Russians. The attacks of the troops under General von der Marwitz and under General von Linsingen also yielded good success.
