Concerning the seizure and inventory of bicycles and bicycle tires. Regulation of bicycle traffic.

SEIZURE.

All bicycles and bicycle components, as well as all newly made, imported, or available, both new and used tires, even those usable only as scrap, bicycle outer and inner tires and their remnants, will be seized, regardless of whether they are completed or still in production and whether they are attached to bicycles or stored separately, as long as they do not belong to German military or civilian administrations.

Items subject to this announcement and not sold to a collection point by 15 September 1916, must be declared, whether stored separately from the bicycles or mounted, or if permission for use has been granted for the bicycles. Declarations must be submitted to the competent Kommandantur by 20 September in duplicate on official declaration forms, available for free at the police office. Those required to make a declaration will receive a written certificate of the made declaration bearing a stamp. A previous declaration or seizure does not exempt from the obligation to declare.

The following are required to declare:

A) the owner.

B) anyone who has the bicycles or tires in possession (holder or warehouse keeper).

C) anyone authorized to dispose of the bicycles or tires for themselves or others.

Declaration by one of the obligated parties does not exempt the others from the obligation to declare.

A.H.Q., 26 August 1916. The Commander-in-Chief Duke ALBRECHT OF WURTTEMBERG.
