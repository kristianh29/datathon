The regulation of food supply

is ordered: 

§ 1. — The transportation of food, pleasure, and feed supplies from one municipality to another is only permitted with a special written permit from the Commandant's office. In such cases, a petition must be submitted to the Commandant’s office along with a written certificate from the mayor stating that there are no objections to the export from the municipality.

§ 2. — Milk, vegetables, and kitchen plants may always be transported without a written permit.

On the contrary, butter, eggs, fish, mussels, and cheeses may only be transported to and from the weekly markets that take place every Tuesday and Friday without the transport permit prescribed in § 1. (On other days, only after obtaining a permit).

§ 3. — The sale of butter and eggs must take place on market days at the designated location in Ghent (Botermarkt). The mayors are required to report the names of the butter and egg suppliers to the Commandant’s office every Saturday and Wednesday and are personally responsible for ensuring that the quantities of butter and eggs, which are determined in advance by the Commandant’s office, are brought to the market in Ghent for public sale.

The arrangements made by the mayors must be followed.

§ 4. — Municipalities that have received goods from the American Relief Committee must possess the prescribed papers from the relief committee and also a transport certificate issued by the Commandant’s office.

§ 5. — Violations of this regulation are punished with a fine of up to 10,000 Marks and a prison sentence of up to 2 years or with one of these punishments. The relevant food, pleasure, and feed supplies are confiscated. Competent are German military authorities and military courts.

§ 6. — In the event of a confiscation reported or initially carried out in the name of the mayors or the Belgian Police and thus the goods are declared confiscated, the seized food, pleasure, and feed supplies will be publicly sold to the highest bidder by the municipal authorities under the supervision of the military police. In this sale, the highest prices set for food, pleasure, and feed supplies may not be exceeded by 80%. The proceeds from this auction are deposited in the treasury of the municipality whose officials made the report.

When the report or confiscation is carried out by German soldiers or military officials, the application follows the order of the Etappen-Inspection of the IV Army dated April 9th (IV A. Tgb. 1177/4).

§ 7. — Any confiscation by the mayors or police officers must be reported to the Commandant’s office, where further instructions are awaited.
