"Notice from the German General Government.

BERLIN, May 31. (Official report from this afternoon.)

Western theater of war.

The French sent considerable forces yesterday to break through our lines north of Arras and in the Priest's Forest. In recent days, the enemy had approached the front Neuville-Roclincourt, near Arras, by means of trenches. We therefore expected an attack on our lines, even more so because all attempts to drive us further northward from our positions had failed. This attack came yesterday afternoon, after an artillery preparation lasting several hours. Brave Rhenish and Bavarian regiments inflicted a complete defeat on the enemy, who suffered exceptionally heavy losses. In the Priest's Forest, the French only succeeded in taking a few of the foremost, weakly occupied trenches. Besides that, the enemy's attack failed in its objectives there as well. Near Ostend, a coastal battery shot down an enemy aircraft. With a few shells, our artillery once again destroyed the railway arch bridge of Dammerkirch; only a few days ago the French, after months of work, had restored it for use.

Eastern theater of war.
