NOTICE

Concerning

requisitioned bulk goods.

The great difficulties associated with the transportation, organization, and assessment of the requisitioned bulk goods in Belgium, as well as the verification of receipts, allow their processing to progress slowly. However, since the holders of such receipts have the legitimate desire to draw funds now for the continuation of their business, purchases, or payment of wages, etc., I have established an

ADVANCE FUND AT THE GENERAL GOVERNOR IN BELGIUM

in Brussels, Wetstraat, 90, which will provide advances on receipts for requisitioned bulk goods. All holders of receipts for requisitioned bulk goods, without distinction, whether they are Germans, allies of Germany, Belgians residing in the country, or neutrals, can make use of this privilege. The advances are provided without interest.

The Advance Fund begins its operations on the 6th of April of the current year. Further instructions regarding transactions with the fund can be obtained at the location itself, from the Head of Civil Administration in the individual provinces, and from the District Chiefs. Additionally, the operational regulations are sent to all major banks and bank branches in the occupied territories of Belgium.

The provision of advances by the Advance Fund does not in any way delay the final payment of receipts for requisitioned bulk goods, as announced in my notice on the 9th of January of the current year. On the contrary, the intervention of the Advance Fund should contribute to speeding up the final settlement, as it helps to organize and examine the submitted receipts.

Brussels, the 2nd of April, 1915.

The General Governor in Belgium
Freiherr von BISSING,
Colonel General.
