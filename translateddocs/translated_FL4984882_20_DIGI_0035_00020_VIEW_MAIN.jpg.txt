Announcements from the Government.

BERLIN, June 11. (Official report from this afternoon.) Western theater of war.

North-East of the Loretto Heights, the enemy's forward movements failed; their repeated attacks on our positions North and South of Neuville met the same fate. The hand-to-hand combat in the trenches north of Ecurie remains undecided. South-East of HÃ©buterne and at Beaumont, we repelled enemy attacks yesterday and last night; only near Serre-Mailly did the French gain a minor advantage. In Champagne, the French attempted last evening to recapture the trenches lost on June 9. With a considerable force, they launched an attack over a wide front, from north of Le Mesnil to north of the Beausejour farm. This attack, which cost the French enormous losses, completely collapsed. New attack attempts during the night could not even be executed. 

Eastern theater of war. North-West of Eiragola, on the lower Dubissa, we repelled several Russian attacks. The enemy left 300 men in our hands.

Southeastern theater of war. In Galicia, the situation for the German troops remains unchanged.
