BERLIN, 24 June. (Official report from this afternoon.)

Western front.

On the eastern slope of the Loretto Heights, we drove the enemy out of a trench section that he had captured a few days ago. South of Souchez, the battles are turning in our favor. We repelled a powerful night attack on our Labyrinth position, south of Neuville, which turned into a fierce hand-to-hand battle, and we maintained our position. On the Meuse Heights, there were again bloody clashes, in which we took 150 French prisoners. Two failed attacks cost the enemy significant losses. We thwarted an attempt on the heights near Bar-de-Sapt, which we have held since yesterday. 50 remained in our hands.

Eastern front.

In a repelled attack to the N.-E. of Kurschany, the Russians lost about 100 men as prisoners. At the Omule, a forward movement led to us capturing the village of Kopaczyska. In Poland, several enemy attacks south of the Vistula were halted.

Southeastern front.

The army of General von Linsingen has crossed the Dniester. It is engaged in heavy fighting on the northern bank between Halicz, still occupied by the enemy, and Zurawno. North of there, to the area east of Lviv and Zolkiew, the Russians are being further pursued. Between Rawaruska and the San, near Ulanow, nothing of importance happened. From the corner formed by the San and the Vistula, the Russians have retreated behind the San. On the left bank of the Vistula, south of Ilza, they are also moving to the north.
