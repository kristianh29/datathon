Article 8. — In the second half of the month of August, the list of school-age children will be handed over to the cantonal inspector by the public school administration. The usual model will be used for this purpose.

In the first half of September, a notice signed by the competent cantonal inspector is posted in each municipality by the municipal authority, reminding the heads of families of the obligations imposed on them by law and the consequences of non-compliance. This notice explicitly states that the head of the family is free to send his children to the school he chooses and that it is forbidden to exert any pressure on him to force him to choose a school that is not of his choice.

The previously provided instructions and notification cards are not sent. Instead, school heads send the cantonal inspector a list of the names of the children enrolled in their school eight days after the reopening of the classes.

Article 9. — Heads of households who, within eight days after the reopening of municipal schools, have not enrolled their children in a municipal, accepted, or acceptable school, or have not informed the cantonal inspector where they have their children educated, are requested by him to provide proof within eight days that they have fulfilled the obligation imposed on them by Article 1 of the law. The cantonal inspector sends these requests to the competent municipal authority, which will hand them to the heads of households against a receipt with a signature. If, after the specified delay, no response is received, the cantonal inspector will report the heads of households who are in default for failing to fulfill the obligation imposed on them by Article 1 to the justice of the peace.
