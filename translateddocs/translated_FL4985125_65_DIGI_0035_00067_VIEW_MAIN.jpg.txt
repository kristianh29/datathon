Regulation concerning the organization of potato supply.

Art. 1.

For the area of the General Government, a "potato supply office" is established in Brussels, which is under the "Chief Administrator" of the General Governor.

Art. 2.

The potato supply office must ensure the distribution of potato stocks to feed the Belgian population. It is authorized, to that end, to also regulate potato consumption.

Art. 3.

Insofar as a municipality does not have the necessary potatoes for the nutrition of the population available, the municipality must, through the mediation of the competent civil commissioner, request the missing quantity.

Art. 4.

To compensate for the shortage (Art. 3), the supply office can determine how much potatoes should be drawn from the production areas. The municipalities within this area are required to provide these quantities. The mayor will determine how many potatoes each producer has to deliver.

Art. 5.

If a producer refuses to surrender them, the "District Chief" can order that the potatoes be expropriated at up to 20% below the prevailing maximum price, if necessary with military assistance, and ownership of the potatoes is transferred to the municipality or person designated in the order. The order must require the owner to separate the quantity to be expropriated within a set period. If he does not comply, the "District Chief" can have the separation carried out at his expense.

When determining the quantities to be expropriated, it must be taken into account what the producer needs to continue his business, especially in terms of seed potatoes.

If the "Chief Administrator" regulates the potato supply for the municipalities without intervention by the potato supply office (Art. 10), the provisions of this article are likewise applicable in case of refusal to deliver potatoes.

Art. 6.

All local authorities must take the necessary measures to supply the population with potatoes. They must especially ensure that enough quantities of potatoes are available for the nutrition of the inhabitants.

Art. 7.

The municipal authorities must set the sale price for the potatoes they procure, which they relinquish directly or through the mediation of trade, according to the provisions of the regulation of September 28, 1915 (Law and Ordinance Gazette p. 1090).

Art. 8.

The municipal authorities can requisition storage places within their jurisdiction for storing their potato stocks. In the absence of an agreement, the "District Chief" decides.

Art. 9.

Municipalities may take over the potato stocks available at the traders, for which prices must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the regulation of September 28, 1915. If traders refuse to surrender their stocks, article 3 is also applicable.

Art. 10.

The "Chief Administrator" is charged with implementing this regulation. He can, in particular, make arrangements regarding the quality of the potatoes to be delivered, the acceptance of transporters, their compensation, and the transport of the potatoes. He is also authorized to regulate the supply of municipalities without the intervention of the potato supply office and to take all other necessary measures to make the potato supply possible in connection with this regulation.

Art. 11.

The settlement of all disputes concerning the delivery of potatoes (Regulation of September 28, 1913, Law and Ordinance Gazette p. 1090, and the present regulation) is solely competent by an arbitration tribunal, which is convened at the request of an interested party by the potato supply office.

Each interested party may choose an arbitrator from the persons designated by name by the supply office for this purpose or request the supply office to choose one for them.

The chosen arbitrators must convene immediately after their appointment, establish the facts, and if they reach a unanimous judgment, communicate the decision, in case a depreciation in figures must be indicated, to each interested party without delay. If they do not agree, then a third arbitrator is appointed by the potato supply office, who decides alone, but must join the opinion of one of the two arbitrators.

The arbitration tribunal is free to consult experts and witnesses.

Articles 1005-1028 of the Belgian Code of Civil Procedure are not applicable to this arbitration tribunal.

The arbitration tribunal decides on the costs of the proceedings, including party costs, at its discretion. The compensation for the members of the arbitration tribunal and experts for their intervention, as well as compensation for loss of time and travel expenses of witnesses, is determined by the potato supply office.

The rulings of the arbitration tribunal are without appeal.

In the event of a dispute between the delivering and receiving municipalities, the request for an arbitration decision must be submitted within 48 hours of the arrival of the potatoes and, if necessary, by telegraph.

Art. 12.

Violations of the regulations issued based on art. 10 are punished with a maximum of one year of detention or imprisonment, or a maximum fine of 10,000 marks. Both penalties can be pronounced simultaneously. Additionally, the goods can be confiscated.

Art. 13.

Art. 14.

The regulation of September 28, 1915, remains in force insofar as it is not contradicted by this regulation.

Namur, January 17, 1916.

The General Governor in Belgium,
Freiherr von BISSING,
Generaloberst.
