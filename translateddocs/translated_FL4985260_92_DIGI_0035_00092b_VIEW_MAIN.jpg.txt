The following need not be delivered:

1) The quantity of butter that the producer or the farmers associated with a dairy need for their own consumption, according to the general rules regarding the consumption of butter (article 10);

2) The quantity of butter that the producer, according to the same rules, leaves to the population of his municipality for their own supply, as well as to the State and municipal administrations, consumption institutions and cooperatives, institutions of public benefit, and other similar institutions listed in paragraph 2, number 1 of article I of the Regulation of July 26, 1916, concerning the regulation of the butter trade (Gazette of Statutes and Regulations, p. 2459).

If a butter producer is completely or partially prevented from fulfilling his delivery obligation, he must properly explain his reasons to the competent civil commissioner (Zivilkommissar).

Article 4.

If the butter is not voluntarily delivered, it may be expropriated at a price 10% below the maximum price for the benefit of the butter sellers' union.

Article 5.

The stocking up of butter reserves by producers and traders is prohibited. The butter reserves accumulated until now by producers and traders will be seized starting September 1, 1916, to be put on the market. Producers and traders must report the butter reserves still available on September 1, 1916, to the State Commissioner of the butter sellers' union in Brussels by September 10, 1916, at the latest.

Article 8.

In addition to police agents, persons authorized by the State Commissioner are also entitled to enter and inspect premises where dairy products are made, stored, or offered for sale. They may also require the submission of business books, accounts, and other commercial documents and inspect them.

Article 9.

Violations of the above provisions, as well as of the Regulation of July 16, 1916 (Gazette of Statutes and Regulations, p. 2411), and the Regulation of July 26, 1916 (Gazette of Statutes and Regulations, p. 2459), are punishable by 8 days to six months imprisonment and with fines of 6 to 300 francs or with one of these penalties.
