From the Municipality

The municipality will assume responsibility for slaughtering cattle necessary for the rationing starting from the 15th of this month, and will manage the distribution of the meat. The fat obtained from the slaughtering, as well as items like pate, sausages, etc., derived from the leftovers will be evenly distributed among the residents.

The sales will only take place on Saturday and Sunday mornings, in larger municipalities in various saleshouses, during the same time. The municipality is responsible for maintaining peace and order during the meat sales. The butchers will receive their slaughtering fees from the municipality. Any refusals from the butchers must be immediately reported to the Commandant's office. The butchers' slaughtering permits must be returned to the commandant's office by the 15th of this month.

The profits made from the slaughtering can be used by the municipality to purchase coal and other necessities for the poor population, for which a report must be given to the Civil Administration of East Flanders.
