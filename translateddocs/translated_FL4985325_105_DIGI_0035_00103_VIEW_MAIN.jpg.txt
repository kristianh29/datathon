Hereby, the attention of those concerned is once again drawn to the fact that within the territory of the General Government only the holders of an identity card made out in their name, of the model below, on which the official seal of the competent authority is affixed and the period of validity is indicated, are authorized to carry out seizures and to make the necessary determinations thereto.

Any misuse of these cards will be severely punished.

Supplementary to the above-mentioned regulation, I specify that civilians making seizures, etc., must simultaneously show the identity card along with their identity certificate. The identity certificate, like the identity card, must include the holder's photograph and signature, as well as the official seal of the competent authority.

Moreover, the agent must, at each seizure, hand over to the former owner a provisional or definitive seizure certificate, on which the serial number, the seizing authority, as well as the seized items, are mentioned.

Brussels, 23rd July 1915.

The Governor-General in Belgium.
Baron von FALKENHAUSEN.
