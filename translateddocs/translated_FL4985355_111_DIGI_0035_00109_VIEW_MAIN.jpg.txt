§ 1. — Every civilian arriving in a place with a military garrison must immediately report to the registration office (Meldeambt), and in places where there is no Meldeambt, to the Ortskommandantur, presenting their travel documents and, if they do not leave the same day, register.

§ 2. — If the person arrives before 7 PM, they must register the same evening; if they arrive after 7 PM, they must register by 12 noon the following day at the latest.

§ 3. — If the arriving person is staying in the place, they must only register when returning from a journey in the operational area.

§ 4. — Registration is proven by placing a stamp with the date on the travel pass, if the arriving person possesses one. These stamps should be placed one below the other in order and time. The left side should be used first, then the right side.

§ 5. — Pedestrians are not exempt from the obligation to register on both arrival and departure.

§ 6. — If the arriving person intends to stay overnight in the place, permission from the military administration is necessary.

The arrivals must provide the name of their host (quartermaster). They receive a registration certificate that contains the time span permitted for their stay and the name of the quartermaster.

For an extension of the stay as well as a change of lodging, new permission is required.

§ 7. — Without a registration certificate, no civilian person may be given lodging. If the arrival took place after 7 PM, the quartermaster is responsible for ensuring the person they are hosting is registered on time the following morning.

§ 8. — The registration certificate must be handed over to the quartermaster. He may only allow the travelers to stay in his home during the period indicated on the registration certificate.

§ 9. — The quartermaster must, as soon as the hosted person has departed, duly fill out the reverse side of the registration certificate and return it to the relevant Meldeambt or the Ortskommandantur.

§ 10. — Persons who enter the operational area and do not depart the same day must have their travel pass taken by the Meldeambt or the Ortskommandantur and returned upon departure.

§ 11. — The Meldeambts or Ortskommandanturen record in a book the name, occupation, residence, and duration of stay of each arriving person who does not leave the same day, as well as the name of the quartermaster, the day of registration, and the day of departure.

§ 12. — All hotels, inns, private pensions, as well as houses that regularly or temporarily accommodate foreigners, must keep registration books and report in these the name, occupation, citizenship, residence, purpose of the trip, duration of the stay, and time of arrival and departure of each hosted person.

An extract of this registration book must be submitted every morning by 9 AM to the competent Belgian police of the place or district. The quartermaster is responsible for ensuring it is submitted correctly and on time.

Those who do not house foreigners as their profession and are therefore not obliged to keep a registration book, must also report by 9 AM to the police of the place or district any persons they hosted.

§ 13. — The police of the place send the received notifications to the Meldeambt or the Ortskommandantur each day by 5 PM, which then compares these notifications with the entries in the registration book.

§ 14. — All hotels, inns, private pensions, and houses that are regularly or temporarily used to accommodate foreigners must be continuously monitored by the police. The Ortskommandanturen must frequently inspect to ensure that the registration books are organized and maintained according to regulations.

§ 15. — Every Belgian prison, penitentiary, reformatory, hospital, and all monasteries or similar institutions must report every arrival and departure within 24 hours after the arrival or departure to the Meldeambt or the Ortskommandantur. If prisoners are to be released, the notification must be made in time for the release and must include where and to which place the prisoner will be released.

The Meldeambts and Ortskommandanturen must notify the competent Meldeambts of every arrival and departure of persons under supervision.

§ 16. — Violations are punishable by up to 1 year in prison or a fine of up to 4000 marks.
