3 and 9 of the Belgian constitution regarding the amendments related to the Education Act of 15 June 1914.

"Articles 8 and 9 of the Act of 15 June 1914 concerning the regulation of primary education are replaced by the following provisions:

Article 8. — In the second half of August, the list of school children is handed over by the municipal authorities to the cantonal inspector. The form used until now is employed for this purpose.

In the first half of September, in each municipality, a notice signed by the competent cantonal inspector is posted by the municipal authority, reminding heads of households of the obligations imposed on them by the law and the consequences of not complying. This notice explicitly states that the head of the household is free to send his children to the school of his choice and that it is forbidden to exert any pressure on him to force him to choose a school that may not be the school of his choice.

The instructions and notification cards previously provided are not sent. Instead, school heads send the cantonal inspector a list with the names of the children enrolled in their school eight days after the reopening of classes.

Article 9. — Heads of households, who, within eight days after the reopening of municipal schools, have not enrolled their children in a municipal, approved, or acceptable school or have not informed the cantonal inspector where they are having their children taught, are requested by the inspector to provide proof within eight days that they have complied with the obligation imposed on them under article 1 of the law. The cantonal inspector sends these requests to the competent municipal authority, which hands them to the heads of households against a receipt with signature. If no response is given after the specified period, the cantonal inspector reports the defaulting heads of households to the justice of the peace for failing to fulfill the obligation imposed on them under article 1.
