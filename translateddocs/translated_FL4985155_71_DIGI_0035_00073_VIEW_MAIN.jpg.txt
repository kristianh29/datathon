Announcement

On April 15, 1916, new passport regulations take effect. The public's attention is hereby drawn to the points that are new for travelers.

I. Proof of identity. As already decreed on October 10, 1915, every person, regardless of citizenship, who has reached the age of 15, regardless of whether he is inside or outside his place of residence, must carry proof of identity.

Anyone entering the country, regardless of citizenship, must report to the competent passport office within 48 hours of arrival, where either his identity card or passport is stamped, i.e., "visé," where he is directed without delay to the Belgian police office that is responsible for his place of residence to obtain an identity card.

Anyone possessing two or more invalid identity cards or exceeding the validity period of the visa on the identity card is punishable.

II. Passports. In addition to the identity card, a passport is required for entering the territory of the General Government, for leaving this territory, and for transit through the General Government.

Regarding travel within the territory of the General Government, the regulations concerning travel to the border zone area along the stage boundary and vice versa have been considerably relaxed. Except for motor traffic and bicycle traffic, a passport is only needed for rail travel from the passport-free area to the train stations in the border zone area and vice versa. On the other hand, control concerning the identity cards near the stage boundary has been tightened.

The regulations for traffic in the border zone area along the Dutch border have not been changed. Bicycle traffic remains prohibited as before and motor vehicle traffic is only permitted for travel to and from the Dutch border.

Traffic from the passport-free area to this border zone and vice versa remains generally prohibited and is only allowed in very exceptional cases when the life or livelihood of the applicant or of close relatives is at stake, or in cases of urgent professional travel of doctors, midwives, nurses, or appointed officials.

The places in the border zone area along the Dutch border and the train stations with passport requirements near the stage boundary are indicated on the maps and lists that hang in all passport offices.

The demarcation line to the Netherlands will otherwise be further adjusted shortly, thereby reducing the border zone area to a minimum.

In the rest of the General Government's area, any traffic—except motor and bicycle traffic—is allowed without a passport. However, persons subject to the registration obligation must have special permission from the competent "Meldeamt" for travel in this passport-free area.

Travel abroad is only allowed when a certificate from a military doctor states that the trip is urgently necessary to preserve health and must undoubtedly be made in the respective country.

The provisions for motor traffic, for which a passport is required throughout the area of the General Government, remain in force.

The provisions of October 10, 1915 for bicycle traffic also remain in force. Violating it can also result in the confiscation of the improperly used bicycle—temporarily or permanently.

The use of passports for travel to countries other than those for which they were issued, as well as exceeding the validity period of passports, is punishable.

Holders of passports and identity cards are responsible for their safekeeping. Losing these documents must be reported immediately to the passport office competent for their temporary place of residence.

Regarding the carrying of letters, written communications, printed materials of all kinds, as well as the carrying of money or valuables, reference is made to the Regulation of April 1, 1916, and to the provisions on the passport.

Whoever violates these regulations issued by me concerning passport and bicycle traffic, particularly whoever obtains or attempts to obtain one of the prescribed documents through false declarations, whoever does not possess a prescribed document, does not carry it with them contrary to the prescriptions or allows third parties to use it; whoever violates the regulations regarding reporting to a passport office, the issuing of the document or the individually imposed prescriptions for a trip, and whoever is in the border zone area without authorization, as well as any official who deliberately or negligently issues a required document incorrectly or incompletely or unjustifiably refuses to issue it, will be punished, unless other more severe penal provisions apply, with up to 3 years of imprisonment or jail or with a fine of up to 20,000 marks. In addition to imprisonment, a fine may also be imposed.

The German military courts and military commanders are competent.

Railway companies, which are forbidden to transport passengers without a passport, must pay a fine of 3 to 30 marks for each violation. Upon refusal to pay this fine and upon repeated violations, governors may prohibit them from continuing their business.

The "Kreischefs" (district chiefs) and commanders are competent for determining the penalties.

The penalty provisions issued in earlier regulations or ordinances on passport and bicycle traffic are hereby repealed.

Brussels, April 7, 1916.

The Governor-General in Belgium,

Freiherr von BISSING,

Colonel General.
