VIENNA, June 13. News from the Russian battlefield.

Between the Dniester and Prut rivers, troops of the army under Pflanzer attacked some Russian positions again. Jezierzany and Niezwiżka, north of Obertyn, were stormed. Our victorious troops are advancing towards Czernelica; east of Horodenka, they have crossed the Dniester. Zaleszeszuki was captured. In the evening and night, the Russians launched desperate attacks on this city, all being repelled with enormous losses for the enemy. An attack by a regiment of Cossacks also completely collapsed under our fire. In Bukovina, the Russians had to abandon their last positions on the Prut. They are retreating across the national borders with heavy losses, pursued by our troops. The army under Pflanzer captured nearly 5,000 prisoners yesterday. South of the upper Dniester, the battle continues. A Russian counterattack on Stanislau was repelled. The allied troops recaptured Zurawno yesterday, a city they had previously evacuated to await Russian reinforcements.

Italian Battlefield.

At the Isonzo, local battles are ongoing; artillery is still being heard there. So far, the Italians have only advanced on the eastern bank at Monfalcone and Karfreit, two places that lie in front of our positions. Yesterday, enemy detachments climbed the heights on the eastern riverbank near Plawa in the early morning, but had to leave soon after. Near the Carinthian border, our troops repelled enemy attacks on the crossings in the area of Monte Paralba and occupied this mountain. Attempts by the Italians to recapture Monte Piano failed. In some border regions, the enemy is gradually approaching our positions; he has occupied Cortina d’Ampezzo, Fiera di Primiero, and Borgo.
