From November 1, 1915, the supervision, as it already applied to Belgians born between the years 1892 to 1897, is extended to all male Belgians born between the years 1885 to 1898 (both inclusive).

In contrast, the troops (not the officers) of the former inactive civic guard, with their completed 30th year of life, are exempt from supervision.

On this occasion, I repeat that the supervision was only introduced to verify the presence of those required to register and to prevent their evasion.

This does not mean enlistment in the German army nor does it imply deportation into captivity.

Brussels, the 20th of October 1915.
The Governor-General in Belgium,

Freiherr von BISSING,
Colonel General.
