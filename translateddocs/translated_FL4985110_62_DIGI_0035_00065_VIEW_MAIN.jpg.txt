Announcement

To my regret, I have been able to ascertain that bicycle traffic, newly permitted by the announcement of February 18, has led to serious abuses by the population.

â€” Therefore, I see myself obliged to order that, from June 26 and until further notice, cyclists may no longer leave the vicinity of their municipality anywhere in the general government area without having a permit.

Violators of these regulations shall be punished with imprisonment of up to 1 year or with a fine of up to 4,000 marks or with imprisonment and fine together.

The boundaries of the vicinity of the municipalities, as defined in this decree, shall be further described by the governors or district chiefs. 

Brussels, 21st June 1915.

The General-Governor in Belgium, Freiherr von BISSING, Generaloberst.
