Announcements from the German General Headquarters

VIENNA, June 15. (Official report from yesterday.)

Russian front:

The troops of the army under Pflanzer continue their victorious advance in Southeast Galicia. Yesterday, after fierce battles, they captured Tysmenica, Tlumacz, and the heights north of Olezza. A battle is underway south of Czernelica. New Russian attacks on Zalesczyki were crushed in blood. Our troops who crossed the state borders at Bukovina have driven the Russians from their strong, border-prepared positions. During the pursuit, we occupied several places in Bessarabia and captured 1,560 prisoners yesterday. On the upper Dniester, the allied troops successfully advance towards Zydaczow, where a significant Russian force still holds the southern bank of the Dniester. In Central Galicia, an attack by Austro-Hungarian and German troops resulted in the capture of Sieniawa; after repelling strong enemy attacks, they stormed all support points northeast of the city. Here, 3,500 Russians fell into their hands. Otherwise, the situation remains unchanged. 

Italian front:

In the last two days, there have been rather significant engagements on the Isonzo, namely at Plava. The attempt by the Ravenna Brigade on June 11 to capture the heights of the eastern bank ended with the enemy's retreat. Yesterday morning, the Italians crossed the river again. After a fierce battle, our troops repelled the enemy, who constantly received reinforcements, and held firmly to their positions, before which more than 400 Italian corpses lie. In the Carinthian and Tyrolean border areas, the artillery remains active.

CONSTANTINOPLE, June 13. The General Headquarters reports: On the Dardanelles front, we repelled the enemy, who repeatedly tried to attack our right wing near Sedd-el-Bahr, with serious losses on the night of June 11 to 12, back to their old positions. On the morning of June 12, the enemy artillery at Ari Burnu fired a large amount of ammunition without achieving the slightest effect. Our Anatolian coastal batteries also successfully targeted the enemy positions yesterday. There is nothing to report from the other fronts. 

The General Command.
