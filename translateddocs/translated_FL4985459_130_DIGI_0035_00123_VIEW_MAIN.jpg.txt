"Ghent, October 1916.

1. Due to culpable violations against the Decree of Ghent dated 17.7.1916, the farmers of the municipality of Merelbeke listed in the attached list are penalized with the fines indicated therein. If the mentioned persons cannot pay the amount, each 5 Mark fine will be replaced by one day of imprisonment. All the accused have wilfully failed to deliver the quantities of eggs specified in the list for the period from 8 to 14 October 1916 or have delivered fewer than required.

For each egg that was underdelivered, a fine of 1 Mark is demanded.

2. The municipality is ordered to inform all municipal members, next to whose name in the list the fine is indicated in red writing, of this decree and the fine, and to summon them on a specific day and hour to the town hall. The day and hour for this meeting will be announced by the Commandantur patrols. The payment of the fine must be made without delay at the appointed time. Anyone who does not pay promptly will be fined five times the amount he was supposed to pay due to disobedience to this order.

Reclamations against the imposed sanctions will not be considered in any case.

3. It is again warned that continued underdelivery of eggs and milk will result in higher fines and, if necessary, simultaneous prison sentences.

All municipal representatives will henceforth be held jointly responsible for the execution of all given orders and decrees.

The Commander Company,
